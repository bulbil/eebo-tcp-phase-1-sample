            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            The I. Chapter.
            
               THe countrie
of Ruſſia was
ſometimes called
Sarmatia. It
chaunged the
name (as ſome
do ſuppoſe) for
that it was parted
into diuerſe
ſmall, and yet abſolute gouernments, not
depending, nor being ſubiect the one to the
other. For Ruſſe in that tongue doth ſignifie
aſmuch as to parte, or diuide. The
Ruſſe reporteth that foure brethren, Trubor,
Rurico, Sinees, and Variuus, diuided
among them the North parts of the countrie.
Likewiſe that the Southpartes were
poſſeſſed by foure other, Kio, Scieko, Choranus,
and their ſiſter Libeda: each calling

his territorie after his owne name. Of
this partition it was called Ruſſia, about the
yeare from Chriſt 860. As for the coniecture
which I find in ſome Coſmographers,
that the Ruſſe nation borrowed the name of
the people called Roxellani, and were the very
ſame nation with them, it is without all
good probabilitie: both in reſpect of the etymologie
of the word (which is very far fet)
and eſpecially for the ſeat and dwelling of
that people,
                  Strabo in his 7. booke of 
                     ••
                  ogr. which was betwixt the two riuers
of Tanais and Boriſthenes, (as Strabo reporteth)
quite an other way from the countrey
of Ruſſia.
            
            When it bare the name of Sarmatia, it was
diuided into two chiefe parts: the White, and
the Blacke. The White Sarmatia was all that
part that lieth towardes the North, and on
the ſide of Lieſtand: as the Prouinces now
called Duyna, Vagha, Vstick, Vologda, Cargapolia,
Nouogradia, &amp;c: whereof Nouograd velica
was the Metropolite, or chiefe cittie.
Blacke Sarmatia was all that countrey that
lieth Southward, towards the Euxin, or Black
Sea: as the dukedome of Volodemer of Moſko,
Rezan, &amp;c. Some haue thought that the
name of Sarmatia was firſt taken,Gen. 10. Ioſeph. l. 1. cap. 14. from one
Sarmates, whom Moſes and Ioſephus call Aſarmathes,
ſonne to Ioktan, and nephew to
Heber, of the poſteritie of Sem. But this ſeemeth

to be nothing but a coniecture taken
out of the likenes of the name Aſarmathes.
For the dwelling of all Ioktans poſteritie is
deſcribed by Moſes, to haue beene betwixt
Meſcha or Maſius (an hill of the Amonites)
and Sephace, neare to the riuer Euphrates.
Which maketh it very vnlikely, that Aſarmathes
ſhould plant any colonies ſo far off
in the North and Northweſt countries.The borders of Ruſſia. It is
bounded Northward by the Lappes and the
North Ocean. On the Southſide by the Tartars,
called Chrimes. Eaſtward they haue the
Nagaian Tartar, that poſſeſſeth all the countrie
on the Eaſt ſide of Volgha, towards the
Caſpian ſea. On the Weſt and Southweſt border
lie Lituania, Liuonia and Polonia.
            
            The whole country being now reduced vnder
the gouernment of one,The ſhires of Ruſſia. cōteyneth theſe
chief Prouinces or Shires. Volodemer, (which
beareth the firſt place in the Emperours ſtile,
becauſe their houſe came of the Dukes of
that countrey) Mosko, Niſnouogrod, Plesko,
Smolensko, Nouogrod velica (or Nouogrod of
the low countrey) Rostoue, Yaruslaue, Bealozera,
Bezan, Duyna, Cargapolia, Meſchora, Vagha,
Vſtuga, Ghaletſa. Theſe are the naturall
ſhires preteyning to Ruſſia. but far greater &amp;
larger then the ſhires of England, though
not ſo well peopled. The other countries or
prouinces which the Ruſſe Emperours haue

gotten perforce added of late to their other
dominion,The Prouinces or countries got by conqueſt. are theſe which follow Twerra,
Youghoria, Permia, Vadska, Boulghoria, Chernigo,
Oudoria, Obdoria, Condora, with a great
part of Siberia: where the people though
they be not natural Ruſſes, yet obey the Emperour
of Ruſſia, and are ruled by the lawes
of his countrie, paying cuſtomes and taxes, as
his owne people doe. Beſides theſe hee hath
vnder him the kingdomes of Cazan and Aſtracan,
gotten by conqueſt not long ſince.
As for all his poſſeſsion in Lituania (to the
number of 30. great townes and more,) with
Narue and Drop in Liuonia, they are quite
gone, beyng ſurpriſed of late yeares by the
kinges of Poland and Sweden. Theſe Shires
and Prouinces are reduced all into foure Iuriſdictions,
which they call Chetfyrds (that is)
Tetrarchies, or Fourthparts. Wherof we are to
ſpeake in the title or chapter, concerning the
Prouinces, and their manner of gouernment.
            The whole countrie is of great length and
breadth.The bredth and length of the countrie. From the North to the South (if you
meaſure from Cola to Astracan which bendeth
ſomewhat Eaſtwarde) it reacheth in
length about 4260. verſt, or miles. Notwithſtanding
the Emperour of Ruſſia hath more
territorie Northward, far beyond Cola vnto
the riuer of Tromſchua, that runneth a 1000.

verſt, welnie beyōd Pechinga, neare to Wardbouſe,
but not intire nor clearly limited, by
reaſon of the kings of Sweden and Denmark,
that haue diuers townes there, aſwell as the
Ruſſe, plotted togither the one with the other:
euery one of them claiming the whole
of thoſe North parts as his owne right. The
breadth (if you go from that part of his territorie
that lieth fartheſt Weſtwarde on the
Narue ſide, to the parts of Siberia eaſtward,
where the Emperour hath his garriſons) is
4400. verſt or thereabouts. A verſt (by their
reckoning) is a 1000. paſes, yet leſſe by one
quarter then an Engliſh mile. If the whole
dominion of the Ruſſe Emperour were all
habitable, and peopled in all places, as it is
in ſome, hee would either hardly hold it all
within one regiment, or be ouer mightie for
all his neighbour Princes.
         
         
            Of the Soyle and Climate.
            The 2. Chapter.
            
               THe ſoyle of the countrie for
the moſt part is of a ſleight
ſandie moulde, yet very
much different one place
from another, for the yeeld
of ſuch thinges as grow out

of the earth. The countrie Northwards towards
the partes of S. Nicolas and Cola, and
Northeaſt towards Siberia, is all very barren,
and full of deſert woods by reaſon of the
clymat, and extremitie of the colde in winter
time. So likewiſe along the riuer Volgha
betwixt the countries of Cazan, and Aſtracan:
where (notwithſtanding the ſoyle is
very fruitefull) it is all vnhabited, ſauing
that vpon the riuer Volgha on the weſt ſide,
the Emperour hath ſome fewe caſtels with
garriſons in them. This hapneth by means
of the Chrim Tartar, that will neyther himſelfe
plant townes to dwell there, (liuing a
wilde and vagrant life) nor ſuffer the Ruſſe
(that is farre off with the ſtrength of his
countrie) to people thoſe partes. From Vologda
(which lieth almoſt 1700. verſt from
the porte of S. Nicholas) downe towardes
Mosko, and ſo towardes the ſouth parte that
bordereth vpon the Chrim, (which conteineth
the like ſpace of 1700. verſt or there abouts)
is a very fruitfull and pleaſant countrie,
yeelding paſture, and corne, with woods
&amp; waters in very great plentie. The like is betwixt
Rezan (that lieth ſoutheaſt frō 
               Mosko)
to Nouograd and Vobsko, that reach fartheſt
towards the northweſt. So betwixt Mosko,
and Smolensko (that lieth ſouthweſt towards
Lituania) is a very fruitful and pleaſant ſoile.
            
               
The whole countrie differeth very much
from it ſelfe, by reaſon of the yeare: ſo that
a man would meruaile to ſee the great alteration
and difference betwixte the winter,
and the ſommer Ruſſia. The whole countrie
in the winter lyeth vnder ſnow, which
falleth continually, and is ſometime of a
yarde or two thicke, but greater towardes
the north. The riuers and other waters are
all froſen vp a varde or more thicke, how
ſwifte or broade ſo euer they bee. And this
continueth commonly fiue moneths, vz,
from the beginning of Nouember till towardes
the ende of March, what time the
ſnow beginneth to melte. So that it would
breede a froſt in a man to looke abroad at
that time, and ſee the winter face of that
countrie.The cold of Ruſſia.
                The ſharpeneſſe of the ayre you
may iudge of by this: for that water dropped
downe or caſt vp into the ayre, congealeth
into Iſe before it come to the ground.
In the extremitie of winter, if you holde
a pewter diſhe or pot in your hand, or any
other mettall (except in ſome chamber
where their warme ſtoaues bee) your fingers
will frieſe faſte vnto it, and drawe of the
ſkinne at the parting. When you paſſe out
of a warme roome into a colde, you ſhall ſenſibly
feele your breath to waxe ſtarke, and
euen ſtifeling with the colde, as you draw it

in and out▪ Diuers not onely that trauell
abroad, but in the very markets, and ſtreats
of their townes, are mortally pinched and
killed withall: ſo that you ſhall ſee many
drop downe in the ſtreates, many trauellers
brought into the townes ſitting dead
and ſtiffe in their ſleddes. Diuers loſe their
noſes, the tippes of their eares, and the bals
of their cheekes, their toes, feete, &amp;c. Many
times when (the winter is very harde
and extreame) the beares and woolfes iſſue
by troupes out of the woodes driuen by
hunger, and enter the villages, tearing and
rauening all they can finde: ſo that the inhabitants
are faine to flie for ſafegard of their
liues. And yet in the Sommer time you ſhall
ſee ſuch a new hew and face of a countrie, the
woods (for the moſt part which are all of fir
and birch) ſo freſh and ſo ſweet, the paſtures
and medowes ſo greene and well growen, (&amp;
that vpō the ſudden) ſuch varietie of flowers,
ſuch noyſe of birdes (eſpecially of Nightingales,
that ſeeme to be more lowde and of a
more variable note then in other countries)
that a man ſhall not lightly trauell in a more
pleaſant countrie.
            And this freſh and ſpeedy grouth of the
ſpring there, ſeemeth to proceede from the
benefite of the ſnow: which all the winter
time being ſpred ouer the whole countrie as

a white robe, &amp; keeping it warme from the
rigour of the froſt, in the ſpring time (when
the ſunne waxeth warme, and diſſolueth it
into water) doth ſo throughly drench and
ſoake the ground, that is ſomewhat of a
ſleight and ſandy mould, &amp; then ſhineth ſo
hotely vpon it againe, that it draweth the
hearbes and plants forth in great plenty and
varietie, in a very ſhort time. As the winter
exceedeth in colde, ſo the ſommer inclineth
to ouer much heat, ſpecially in the moneths
of Iune, Iuly, and Auguſt, being much warmer
then the ſommer ayre in England.
            The countrie throughout is very well watred
with ſprings, riuers, &amp; ozeraes, or lakes.
Wherein the prouidence of God is to bee
noted, for that much of the countrie beyng
ſo farre inland, as that ſome parte lieth a
1000. miles and more euery way from any
ſea, yet it is ſerued with faire riuers, and that
in very great number, that emptiyng themſelues
one into an other, runne all into the
ſea. Their lakes are many and large, ſome of
60. 80. 100. and 200. miles long, with
breadth proportionate.
            The chief riuers are theſe 1. Volgha,
               The chief riuers of Ruſſia.
                that
hath his head or ſpring at the roote of an
Aldertree, about 200. verſt aboue Yaruſlaue,
&amp; groweth ſo big by the encreaſe of other
riuers by that time it commeth thither, that

it is broad an Engliſh mile and more, and ſo
runneth into the Caspian ſea, about 2800.
verſt or miles of length.
            The next is Boriſthenes (now called Neper)
that diuideth the countrie from Lituania,
and falleth into the Euxin ſea.
            The third Tanais or Don, (the auncient
bounder betwixt Europe and Aſia) that taketh
his head out of Rezan Ozera, and ſo
running through the countrie of the Chrim
Tartar, falleth into the great ſea lake, or
meare, (called Maeotis) by the Citie of Azou.
By this riuer (as the Ruſſe reporteth) you may
paſſe from their citie Mosko to Conſtantinople,
and ſo into all thoſe partes of the
world by water, drawing your boate (as their
manner is) ouer a little Iſthmus or narrow
ſlippe of lande, a fewe verſts ouerthwart.
Which was proued not long ſince by an Ambaſſadour
ſent to Conſtantinople, who paſſed
the riuer of Moskua and ſo into an other called
Ocka, whence he drew his boate ouer into
Tanais, and thence paſſed the whole way
by water.
            The fourth is called Duyna, many hundred
miles long, that falleth Northward into
the Baye of Saint Nicholas, and hath great
Alabaſter rockes on the bankes towards the
ſea ſide.
            The fifth Duna, that emptieth into the

               Baltick ſea by the towne Riga.
            
            The ſixt Onega, that falleth into the Bay
at Solouetsko 90. verſt from the port of Saint
Nicholas. This riuer below the towne Cargapolia
meeteth with the riuer Volock, that
falleth into the Finland ſea by the towne
Yama. So that from the port of S. Nicholas
into the Finland ſea, and ſo into the Sound,
you may paſſe all by water, as hath bene tried
by the Ruſſe.
            
            The ſeuenth Suchana, that floweth into
Duyna, and ſo into the North ſea.
            The eight Ocka, that fetcheth his head
from the borders of the Chrim, &amp; ſtreameth
into Volgha.
            
            The ninth Moskua, that runneth thorough
the citie Mosko, and giueth it the name.
            There is Wichida alſo a very large and
long riuer that riſeth out of Permia, and falleth
into Volgha. All theſe are riuers of very
large ſtreames, the leaſt to be compared to
the Thames in bigneſſe, and in length farre
more, beſides diuers other. The Pole at Moſko
is 55. degrees 10. minutes. At the porte
of S. Nicholas towards the North 63. degrees
and 50 minutes.
         
         
            
            The natiue commodities of the
Countrie.
            The 3. Chapter.
            
               FOr kindes of
fruites,The fruites and graine of Ruſſia.
                they haue
Appels, Peares,
plummes, cheries,
redde and blacke,
(but the blacke
wild) a deene like
a muske, millian,
but more ſweete &amp;
pleaſant, cucumbers &amp; goords (which they
call Arbouſe) raſps, ſtrawberies, and hurtilberies,
with many other bearies in great
quantitie in euery wood and hedge. Their
kindes of graine are wheat, rie, barley, oates,
peaſe, buckway, pſnytha, that in taſte is
ſomewhat like to rice. Of all theſe graynes
the countrie yeeldeth very ſufficient with an
ouerplus quantitie, ſo that wheate is ſolde
ſometime for two alteens or ten pence ſtarling
the Chetfird, which maketh almoſt three
Engliſh buſhels.
            Their rye is ſowed before the winter, all
their other graine in the ſpring time, &amp; for
the moſt parte in May. The Permians and
ſome other that dwell far north, and in deſert

places, are ſerued from the partes that
lye more Southward, and are forced to make
bread ſometimes of a kinde of roote (called
Vaghnoy) and of the middle rine of the firre
tree. If there be any dearth (as they accounted
this laſt yeare, An. 1588. wheat and rye
beyng at 13. alteens, or 5. ſhillings 5. pence
ſtarling the Chetfird) the fault is rather in the
practiſe of their Nobilitie that vſe to engroſſe
it, then in the countrie it ſelfe.
            The natiue commodities of the countrie
(wherewith they ſerue both their owne
turnes,The chiefe commodities of the countrie. and ſende much abroad to the great
enriching of the Emperour, and his people)
are many and ſubſtantiall.1. Furres. Firſt, furres of
all ſortes. Wherein the prouidence of God
is to be noted, that prouideth a naturall remedie
for them, to helpe the naturall inconuenience
of their countrie by the colde of
the Clymat. Their chiefe furres are theſe,
Blacke fox, Sables, Luſernes, Dunne fox, Martrones,
Gurneſtalles or Armins, Laſets or Miniuer,
Beuer, Wuluerins, the ſkin of a great water
Ratte that ſmelleth naturally like muske, Calaber
or Gray ſquirrell, red ſquirrell, red, &amp; white
Foxe. Beſides the great quantitie ſpent
within the countrie (the people beyng clad
all in furres the whole winter) there are
tranſported out of the countrie ſome yeares
by the marchants of Turkie, Perſia, Bougharia,

Georgia, Armenia, and ſome other of Chriſtendome
to the value of foure or fiue hundred
thouſand rubbels, as I haue heard of
the Marchants. The beſt Sable furre groweth
in the countrie of Pechora, Momgoſorſkoy
and Obdorskoy, the worſer ſort in Siberia,
Perm, and other places. The blacke fox
and redde come out of Siberia, white &amp; dun
from Pechora, whence alſo come the white
wolfe, and white Beare skin. The beſt Wuluerin
alſo thence and from Perm. The beſt
Martrons are from Syberia, Cadam, Morum,
Perm, and Cazan. Lyſerns, Mineuer, and Armins
the beſt ar out of Gallets, and Ouglites,
many from Nouogrod, and Perm. The Beauer
of the beſt ſort breedeth in Murmonskey by
Cola. Other cōmon furres, and moſt of theſe
kindes grow in many, and ſome in all partes
of the countrie.
            The ſecond cōmoditie is of Wax,2. Waxe. whereof
hath bene ſhipped into forraine countries
(as I haue heard it reported by thoſe
that beſt know it) the ſumme of 50000.
pood yearlie, euery pood conteyning 40.
pound, but now about 10000. pood a yeare.
            The third is their Hony,3. Hony. whereof beſides
an exceeding great quantitie ſpent in their
ordinary drinks (which is mead of al ſorts) &amp;
their other vſes, ſome good quantitie is carried
out of the countrie. The chiefe encreaſe

of honie is in Mordua &amp; Cadam neare to the
Cheremiſſen Tartar: much out of Seuerskoy,
Rezan, Morum, Cazan, Dorogoboſe, &amp; Vaſma.
            
            Fourthly,4. Tallow. of Tallow they afoord a great
waight for tranſportation: not only for that
their countrie hath very much good ground
apt for paſturage of cattaile, but alſo by reaſon
of their many Lents and other faſtes:
and partly becauſe their greater menne vſe
much waxe for their lightes, the poorer and
meaner ſorte birch dried in their ſtoaues,
and cut into long ſhiuers, which they call
Luchineos. Of tallow there hath bene ſhipped
out of the realme a fewe yeares ſince about
a 100000. pood yearely, now not paſt
30000. or thereabonts. The beſt yeeld of tallow
is in the parts &amp; territories of Smolensko,
Yaruſlaue, Ouglits, Nouogrod, and Vologda, Otfer,
and Gorodetskey.
            
            An other principall commoditie is their
Loſh and Cowe hide.5. Hide. Their Loſh or Buffe
hide is very faire and large. Their bull and
cowe hide (for oxen they make none, neyther
yet weather) is of a ſmall ſiſe. There
hath bene tranſported by Marchants ſtrangers
ſome yeares, a 100000. hydes. Now it is
decreaſed to a 30000. or thereabouts. Beſides
great ſtore of goates skinnes, whereof
great numbers are ſhipped out of the countrie.
The largeſt kind of Loſh or Buffe breedeth

about Roſtoue, Wichida, Nouogrod, Morum,
and Perm. The leſſer ſorte within the
kingdome of Cazan.
            
            An other very great and principall commoditie
is their Trane oyle,
               6. Trane oyle. drawen out of the
ſeal fiſh.The manner of hunting the Seal fiſh. Where it will not bee impertinent
to ſhewe the manner of their hunting the
ſeal, which they make this oyle of: which is
in this ſort. Towardes the ende of ſommer
(before the froſt begin) they go downe with
their boates into the Bay of S. Nicholas, to a
cape called Cuſconeſſe or Foxnoſe, where they
leaue their boates till the next ſpring tide.
When the ſunne waxeth warme towarde
the ſpring, and yet the yſe not melted within
the Bay, they returne thither againe.
Then drawing their boates ouer the ſea yſe,
they vſe them for houſes to reſt and lodge
in. There are commonly about 17. or 18.
fleete of them, of great large boates, which
diuide themſelues into diuers companies,
fiue or ſix boates in a conſort.
            They that firſt finde the haunt, fire a beacon,
which they carry with them for the
nonce. Which being eſpied by the other cō
               panies,
by ſuch among them as are appoynted
of purpoſe, they come altogither and
compaſſe the ſeales round about in a ring,
that lye ſunning themſelues togither vpon
the yſe, cōmonly foure or fiue thouſand in a

ſhoale, and ſo they inuade them euery man
with his clubbe in his hand. If they hit them
on the noſe, they are ſoone killed. If on the
ſides or backe they beare out the blow, and
many times ſo catche and holde downe the
club with their teeth by main force, that the
party is forced to cal for help to his fellowes.
            The manner of the Seals is, when they ſee
themſelues beſet, to gather all cloſe together
in a throng or plumpe, to ſway downe the
yſe, and to break it (if they can) which ſo bendeth
the yſe that many times it taketh the ſea
water vpon it, and maketh the hunters to
wade a foot or more deepe. After the ſlaughter,
when they haue killed what they can they
fall to ſharing euery boate his part in equall
portions: and ſo they flay them taking from
the body the skin, and the lard or fat withall
that cleaueth to the skin. This they take with
them, leauing the bodies behind, and ſo goe
to ſhore. Where they digge pits in the groūd
of a fadome and an halfe deepe, or there about,
and ſo taking the fat or larde off from
the skinne they throw it into the pit, and caſt
in among it hoat burning ſtones to melt it
withall. The vppermoſt and pureſt is ſolde &amp;
vſed to oyle wooll for cloth, the groſſer (that
is of a red colour) they ſell to make ſope.
            Likewiſe of Ickary or Cauery, a great quantitie
is made vpon the riuer of Volgha out of

the fiſh called Bellougina,
               Ickary. 9, the Sturgeon, the Seueriga
&amp; the Sterledey. Wherof the moſt part
is ſhipped by French and Netherlandiſh marchants
for Italy and Spaine, ſome by Engliſh
marchants.
            The next is of Flaxe and Hempe,8. Hempe and flaxe. whereof
there hath bin ſhipped (as I haue heard marchants
ſay) at the port of Narue a great part
of a 100. ſhips ſmal &amp; great yerely. Now, not
paſt fiue. The reaſon of this abating and decreaſe
of this &amp; other cōmodities, that were
wont to be tranſported in a greater quantitie,
is the ſhutting vp of the port of the Narue
towards the Finland ſea, which now is in
the hands &amp; poſſeſsion of the Sweaden. Likewiſe
the ſtopping of the paſſage ouerland
by the way of Smolensko, and Plotsko, by reaſō
of their warres with the Polonian, which cauſeth
the people to be leſſe prouidēt in mainteining
and gathering theſe &amp; like commodities,
for that they lack ſales. Partly alſo for
that the marchāts &amp; Mouſicks (for ſo they cal
the cōmon ſort of people) are very much diſcouraged
by many heauy &amp; intollerable exactions,
that of late time haue bin impoſed vpon
them: no man accounting that which he
hath to be ſure his own. And therfore regard
not to lay vp any thing, or to haue it before
hand, for that it cauſeth thē many times to
be fleeſed &amp; ſpoiled not only of their goods,

but alſo of their liues. For the grouth of flaxe
the prouince of Vobsko and the countrey about
is the chiefe and only place. For hemp
Smolensko, Dorogoboſe and Vaſma.
            
            The countrey beſides maketh great ſtore of
ſalt.9. Salt. Their beſt ſalt is made at Stararouſe in very
great quātity, where they haue great ſtore
of ſalt wels, about 250. verſt frō the ſea. At Aſtracan
ſalt is made naturally by the ſea water,
that caſteth it vp into great hils, and ſo it
is digged down, and caried away by the marchants
&amp; other that wil fetch it from thence.
They pay to the Emperor for acknowledgement
or cuſtome 3. d. Ruſſe vpon euery hundred
weight. Beſides theſe two, they make
ſalt in many other places of the Realme, as in
Perm, Wichida, Totma, Kenitſma, Solouetske, Ocona,
Bōbaſey, &amp; Nonocks, al out of ſalt pits, ſaue
at Solouetskey, which lieth neere to the ſea.
            Likewiſe of tarre they make a great quā
               tity
out of their firre trees in the countrie of
Duyna &amp; Smolensko,
               10. Tarre. whereof much is ſent abroad.11. Ribazuba.
Beſides theſe (which are all good and
ſubſtantial commodities) they haue diuers other
of ſmaller account, that are natural and
proper to that countrey: as the fiſhe tooth
(which they cal Ribazuba which is vſed both
among thēſelues &amp; the Perſians &amp; Boughariās
that fetcht it from thence for beads, kniues,
&amp; ſword hafts of Noblemen, &amp; gentlemē, &amp;

for diuers other vſes. Some vſe the powder
of it againſt poyſon, as the Vnicornes horne.
The fiſh that weareth it is called a Morſe, &amp; is
caught about Pechora. Theſe fiſhe teeth ſome
of them, are almoſt two foote of length, and
weigh eleuen or twelue pound apiece.
            In the prouince of Corelia,
               12. Slude. and about the riuer
Duyna towardes the North ſea, there
groweth a ſoft rocke which they call Slude.
This they cut into pieces, and ſo teare it into
thin flakes, which naturally it is apt for and
ſo vſe it for glaſſe-lanthorns and ſuch like. It
giueth both inwards and outwards a clearer
light then glaſſe, and for this reſpect is better
then either glaſſe or horne: for that it neither
breaketh like glaſſe,13. Saltpee
                  
                     ••
                  r &amp; brimſtone. nor yet will burne
like the lanthorne. Saltpeter they make in
many places, as at Ouglites, Yaruslaue and Vſtug,
and ſome ſmall ſtore of brimſtone vpon
the riuer Volgha, but want skill to refine it.
Their iron is ſomewhat brittle,4. Iron. but a great
weight of it is made in Corelia, Cargapolia, and
Vſtug Theleſna. Other myne they haue none
growing within the Realme.
            Their beaſts of ſtrange kinds are the Losh,The ſtrāge

the Ollen, the wilde Horſe, the Beare, the
Woluering, or wood dogge, the Lyſerne, the
Beauer, the Sable, the Martron, the blacke and
dunne Foxe, the white Beare towardes the
Sea coaſt of Pechora, the Gurnſtale, the Laſet

or Mineuer. They haue a kinde of Squirrel
that hath growing on the pinion of the
ſhoulder bone, a long tuft of haire, much like
vnto feathers, with a farre broader tayle then
haue any other ſquirrels, which they moue &amp;
ſhake as they leape from tree to tree, much
like vnto a wing. They skiſe a large ſpace, and
ſeeme for to flie withall, and therefore they
call them Letach Vechſhe, that is, the flying
ſquirrels. Their hares and ſquirrels in Sommer
are of the ſame colour with ours, in winter
the Hare changeth her coate into milke
white, the ſquirrell into gray, whereof commeth
the Calaber.
            
            They haue fallow Deere, the roe Bucke,
and goates very great ſtore. Their horſes are
but ſmall, but very ſwift and harde, they trauell
them vnſhod both winter and Sommer,
without all regard of pace. Their ſheepe are
but ſmall and beare coorſe, and harſh wooll.
Of foule, they haue diuers of the principall
kindes: Firſt, great ſtore of Hawkes, the Eagle,
the Gerfaulcon, the Slightfaulcon, the
Goſhawke, the Taſſel, the Sparhawk, &amp;c. But
the principall hawke that breedeth in the
countrey, is counted the Gerfaulcon.
            Of other foules their principall kinds are
the ſwanne tame and wilde, (where of they
haue great ſtore) the Storke, the Crane, the
Tedder, of the colour of a Feaſant, but farre

bigger and liueth in the firre woods. Of
Feaſant and Partridge they haue very great
plentie. An owle there is of a very great bigneſſe,
more vglie to beholde then the owles
of this countrey, with a broade face, &amp; eares
much like vnto a man.
            For freſh water fiſh beſides the common
ſorts (as Carpe Pikes Pearch, Tench, Roach,
&amp;c.) they haue diuers kinds very good &amp; delicate:
as the Bellouga, or Bellougina of 4. or 5.
elnes long, the Oſitrina or Sturgeō, the Seueriga,
&amp; Sterledy ſomewhat in faſhion and taſte
like to the Sturgeon, but not ſo thicke nor
long. Theſe 4. kinds of fiſh breed in the volgha,
&amp; are catched in great plenty, &amp; ſerued
thence into the whole Realme for a great
food. Of the Roes of theſe foure kinds they
make very great ſtore of Icary or Caueary as
was ſaid before.
            They haue beſides theſe that breed in the
volgha a fiſh called the Riba bela, or white ſalmon
which they account more delicate thē
they do the redde ſalmon wherof alſo they
haue exceeding great plentie in the riuers
northward, as in Duyna the riuer of Cola, &amp;c.
In the Ozera or lake neere a towne called
Periſlaue, not far frō the Mosko, they haue a
ſmal fiſh which they call the freſh herring, of
the faſhion, and ſomewhat of the taſte of
a Sea-hearing. Their chiefe townes for

fiſh are, Yaruſlaue, Bealozera, Nouogrod, Astracan,
and Cazan: which all yeeld a large
cuſtome to the Emperour euery yeere for
their trades of fiſhing, which they practiſe in
Sommer, but ſend it frozen in the Winter
time into all partes of the Realme.

            The citie of Mosko is ſuppoſed to be of
great antiquitie,Mosko. though the firſt founder be
vnknowen to the Ruſſe. It ſeemeth to haue
takē the name from the riuer that runeth on
the one ſide of the town. Beroſus the Chaldean
in his 5. book telleth that Nimrod (whom other
prophane ſtories cal Saturn) ſēt Aſſyrius,
Medus, Moſcus, &amp; Magog into Aſia to plant

Colonies there, and that Moſcus planted
both in Aſia and Europe. Which may make
ſome probability, that the city, or rather the
riuer whereon it is built, tooke the denomination
from this Moſcus: the rather bicauſe
of the climate or ſituation, which is in the very
fartheſt part and liſt of Europe, bordering
vpon Aſia. The citie was much enlarged by
one Euan or Iohn, ſonne to Daniel, that firſt
changed his title of Duke into King: though
that honour continued not to his poſterity:
the rather becauſe he was inueſted into it by
the Popes Legate, who at that time was Innocentius
the fourth about the yeere 1246.
which was very much miſliked by the Ruſſe
people, being then a part of the Eaſterne or
Greeke Church, Since that time the name of
this citie hath growen more famous, and better
knowen to the worlde: inſomuch that
not onely the prouince, but the whole countrey
of Ruſſia is tearmed by ſome by the
name of Moſcouia the Metropolite citie. The
forme of this citie is in manner round with
three ſtrong walles, circuling the one within
the other, and ſtreets lying betweene, wherof
the inmoſt wall, and the buildings cloſed
within it (lying ſafeſt as the heart within the
bodie, fenced and watred with the riuer Moskua,
that runneth cloſe by it) is all accounted
the Emperours caſtle. The number of

houſes (as I haue heard) through the whole
citie (being reckoned by the Emperour a
little before it was fired by the Chrim) was
41500, in all. Since the Tartar beſieged and
fired the town (which was in the yeare 1571.)
there lieth waſte of it a great breadth of
ground, which before was well ſet and planted
with buildings, ſpecially that part on the
ſouth ſide of Moskua, built not long before
by Baſilius the Emperour for his garriſon of
ſouldiours, to whom he gaue priuiledge to
drinke Mead, &amp; Beer at the drye or prohibited
times, when other Ruſſes may drinke
nothing but water, and for that cauſe called
this newe citie by the name of Naloi, that is,
skinck or poure in. So that now the Citie of
Mosko is not much bigger then then the citie of
London.Nouograde. The next in greatnes, and in a manner
as large, is the citie Nouograde: where was
committed (as the Ruſſe ſaith) the memorable
warre ſo much ſpoke of in ſtories of the
Scythian ſeruants, that tooke armes againſt
their maiſters: which they report in this
ſort: vz. That the Boiarens or Gentlemen of
Nouograde and the territorie about (which
onely are ſouldiers after the diſcipline of
thoſe countries) had warre with the Tartars.
Which being well perfourmed and ended by
thē, they returned homewards. Where they
vnderſtood by the way that their Cholopey
               
or bondſlaues whome they left at home, had
in their abſence poſſeſſed their townes, lands,
houſes, wiues, and all. At which newes being
ſomewhat amaſed, and yet diſdayning
the villanie of their ſeruants, they made the
more ſpeed home: and ſo not farre from Nouograd
met them in warlike manner marching
againſt them. Whereupon aduiſing what
was beſt to bee done, they agreed all to ſet
vpon them with no other ſhewe of weapon
but with their horſe whips (which as their
manner is euery man rideth withall) to put
them in remembrance of their ſeruile condition,
thereby to terrifie them, &amp; abate their
courage. And ſo marching on &amp; laſhing altogither
with their whips in their hands they
gaue the onſet. Which ſeemed ſo terrible in
the eares of their villaines, and ſtroke ſuch a
ſenſe into them of the ſmart of the whip
which they had felt before, that they fled altogether
like ſheepe before the driuers. In
memory of this victory the Nouogradiās euer
ſince haue ſtāped their coine (which they cal
a dingoe Nouogrodskoy currāt through al Ruſſia)
with the figure of a horſeman ſhaking a
whip a loft in his hand. Theſe two cities exceed
the reſt in greatnes. For ſtrength their
chief townes are Vobsko, Smolensko, Cazan &amp;
Aſtracan, as liyng vpon the borders. But for
ſituation Iaruſlaue. farre exceedeth the reſt.Iaruſlaue.
               
For beſides the commodities that the ſoyle
yeeldeth of paſture &amp; corne, it lieth vpon the
famous river Volgha, &amp; looketh ouer it frō
a high banke very faire &amp; ſtately to behold:
wherof the towne taketh the name. For Iaruſlaue
in that tongue ſignifieth as much as
a faire or famous bāke. In this towne (as may
be gheſſed by the name) dwelt the Ruſſe king
vlademir ſirnamed Iaruſlaue, that married the
daughter of Harald king of England, by mediation
of Sueno the Dane, as is noted in the
Daniſh ſtorie about the yeare 1067.
            The other townes haue nothing that is
greatly memorable, ſaue many ruines within
their walles. Which ſheweth the decreaſe of
the Ruſſe people, vnder this gouernment.
The ſtreates of their cities and townes in
ſteed of pauing, are planked with firre trees,
plained and layed euen cloſe the one to the
other.The manner of Ruſſe buylding. Their houſes are of wood without
any lime or ſtone, built very cloſe and warm
with ſirre trees plained and piled one vpon
an other. They are faſtened together with
dentes or notches at euery corner, and ſo
claſped faſt together. Betwixt the trees or
timber they thruſt in moſſe (whereof they
gather plentie in their woods) to keepe out
the ayre. Euery houſe hath a paire of ſtaiers
that lead vp into the chambers out of the
yarde or ſtreat after the Scottiſh manner.

This building ſeemeth farre better for their
countrie, then that of ſtone and bricke: as
being colder and more dampiſh then their
woodden houſes, ſpecially of firre, that is a
dry and warme wood. Whereof the prouidence
of God hath giuen them ſuch ſtore, as
that you may build a faire houſe for twentie
or thirtie rubbels or little more, where wood
is moſt ſcant. The greateſt inconuenience of
their woodden building is the aptnes for firing,
which happeneth very oft and in very
fearful ſort, by reaſon of the drineſſe and fatneſſe
of the firre, that being once fired, burneth
like a torch, and is hardly quenched till
all be burnt vp.
         
         
            Of the houſe or ſtocke of the
Ruſſe Emperours.
            The 5. Chapter.
            
               THe ſyrname of the imperiall
houſe of Ruſsia, is called Beala.
It tooke the originall (as is
ſuppoſed) from the Kinges of
Hungarie. Which may ſeeme
the more probable for that
the Hungarian Kings many yeares agoe haue
borne that name: as appeareth by Bonfinius
               
and other ſtories written of that countrie.
For about the yeare 1059 mention is made
of one Beaela that ſucceeded his brother Andreas,
who reduced the Hungarians to the
Chriſtian faith from whence they were fallen
by atheiſme and Turkiſh perſwaſion before.
The ſecond of that name was called Beala the
blinde, after whom ſucceeded diuers of the
ſame name.
            That their aunceſtrie came not of the Ruſſe
nation,The houſe Beala not naturall Ruſſe.
                
               Iuan vaſilowich father to this Emperour
would many times boaſt, diſdaining (as
ſhould ſeeme) to haue his progenie deriued
from the Ruſſe bloud. As namely to an Engliſhman
his goldſmith, that had receiued bullion
of him to make certain plate: whom the
Emperour commaunded to looke well to his
waight. For my Ruſſes (ſayd he) are theeues
all. Whereat the workeman looking vpon
the Emperour, began to ſmile. The Emperour
being of quicke conceipt, charged him
to tell him what he ſmiled at. If your Maieſtie
will pardon me (quoth the goldſmith)
I will tell you. Your highneſſe ſaid that the
Ruſſes were all theeues, and forgot in the
meane while that your ſelfe was a Ruſſe. I
thought ſo (quoth the Emperour) but thou
art deceiued. For I am no Ruſſe, my aunceſtors
were Germanes (for ſo they account of the
Hungarians to be part of the Germane natiō
               
though in deed they come of the Hunnes.
That inuaded thoſe countries and reſted in
thoſe parts of Pannonia, now called Hungary.
            
            How they aſpired to the Dukedome of
Volodemer (which was their firſt degree, and
ingrafting into Ruſsia) and whether it were
by cōqueſt, or by marriage, or by what other
meanes, I could not learne any certentie among
them.The aduoncement of the houſe of Beala.
                That from theſe beginnings of
a ſmall Dukedome (that bare notwithſtanding
an abſolute gouernment with it, as at
that time did alſo the other Shires or Prouinces
of Ruſsia) this houſe of Beala ſpred it
ſelfe foorth, and aſpired by degrees to the
monarchie of the whole countrie, is a thing
well knowen, and of very late memorie. The
chiefe of that houſe that aduaunced the
ſtocke, and enlarged their dominions, were
the three laſt that raigned before this Emperour,
to wit. Iuan Baſileus, &amp; Iuan father to
the other that raigneth at this time. Wherof
the firſt that tooke vnto him the name and
title of Emperour, was Baſileus father to Iuan,
&amp; grandfather to this man. For before that
time they were contented to be called great
Dukes of Mosko. What hath bene done by
either of theſe three, and how much they
haue added to their firſt eſtate by conqueſt or
otherwiſe, may bee ſeene in the chapter of
their colonies, or purchaſes perforce. For

the cōtinuance of the race, this houſe of Beala
at this preſent is in like caſe as are many
of the greateſt houſes of Chriſtendome vz.
the whole ſtocke and race concluded in one,
two or ſome fewe of the bloud. For beſides
the Emperour that now is, who hath no
childe (neither is like euer to haue for ought
that may be coniectured by the conſtitution
of his body, and the barenneſſe of his wife after
ſo many yeares marriage) there is but one
more vz. a child of ſixe or ſeuen yeares old,
in whom reſteth all the hope of the ſucceſſion,
and the poſteritie of that houſe. As for
the other brother that was eldeſt of the
three, and of the beſt towardneſſe, he died
of a blowe giuen him by his father vpon the
head in his furie with his walking ſtaffe, or
(as ſome ſay) of a thruſt with the prong of
it driuen deepe into his head. That he meant
him no ſuch mortall harme when hee gaue
him the blow, may appeare by his mourning
and paſsion after his ſonnes death, which neuer
left him till it brought him to the graue.
Wherein may be marked the iuſtice of God,
that puniſhed his delight in ſhedding of
bloud with this murder of his ſonne by his
owne hand, and ſo ended his dayes and tyrannie
together, with the murdering of himſelfe
by extreame griefe, for this his vnhappie
and vnnaturall fact.
            
               
The Emperours yonger brother of ſixe or
ſeuen years old (as was ſaid before) is kept in
a remote place from the Mosko, vnder the
tuition of his mother and hir kinred of the
houſe of the Nagaies: yet not ſafe (as I haue
heard) from attempts of making away by practiſe
of ſome that aſpire to the ſucceſsion, if
this Emperour die without any iſſue. The
nurſe that taſted before him of certaine meat
(as I haue heard) died preſently. That hee is
naturall ſonne to Ioan Vaſilowich, the Ruſſe
people warrant it, by the Fathers qualitie that
beginneth to appeare already in his tender
yeares. He is delighted (they ſay) to ſee ſheepe
and other cattel killed, and to looke on their
throtes while they are bleeding (which commonly
children are afraid to beholde) and
to beate geeſe and hennes with a ſtaffe till
he ſee them lie dead. Beſides theſe of the
male kind, there is a widdow, that hath right
in the ſucceſsion, ſiſter to the old Emperour,
and aunt to this man, ſomtime wife to Magnus
Duke of Holſt, brother to the king of
Denmarke, by whom ſhee had one daughter.
This woman ſince the death of hir huſband
hath bene allured again into Ruſsia by ſome
that loue the ſucceſsion better then hir ſelfe,
which appeareth by the ſequele. For hir ſelfe
with hir daughter ſo ſoone as they were returned
into Ruſsia were thruſt into a Nunnerie,

where hir daughter died this laſt yeare
while I was in the countrie, of no naturall
diſeaſe as was ſuppoſed. The mother remaineth
ſtill in the Nunnerie, where (as I haue
heard) ſhee bewayleth hir ſelfe, and curſeth
the time when ſhe returned into Ruſsia, entiſed
with the hope of marriage, and other
fayre promiſes in the Emperours name▪
Thus it ſtandeth with the imperiall ſtock of
Ruſsia of the houſe of Beala, which is like to
determine in thoſe that now are, &amp; to make
a conuerſion of the Ruſſe eſtate. If it be into
a gouernment of ſome better temper, and
milder conſtitution, it will be happy for the
poore people that are now oppreſſed with
intollerable ſeruitude.
         
         
            Of the manner of crowning or inauguration
of the Ruſſe Emperours.
            The 6. Chapter.
            
               THe ſolemnities vſed at the
Ruſſe Emperours coronatiō,
are on this manner. In the
great Church of Precheſte (or
our Lady) within the Emperours
caſtle is erected a ſtage,

whereon ſtandeth a ſcrine that beareth vpon
it the Imperiall cappe and robe of very riche
ſtuffe. When the day of the Inauguration is
come, there reſorte thither, firſt the Patriarch
with the Metropolitanes, Archbiſhops,
Biſhops, Abbots, and Priors, all richly clad
in their Pontiſicalibus. Then enter the Deacons
with the quier of ſingers. Who ſo ſoone
as the Emperour ſetteth foote into the
Church, beginne to ſing: Many yeares may
liue noble Theodore Iuanowich &amp;c: Whereunto
the Patriarch and Metropolite with the
reſt of the Cleargie, anſwere with a certaine
Hymne, informe of a prayer, ſinging it all
together with a greatnoyſe. The hymne beyng
ended, the Patriarch with the Emperour
mount vp the ſtage, where ſtandeth a
ſeat ready for the Emperour. Whereupon the
Patriarch willeth him to ſit downe, and then
placing himſelfe by him vpon an other ſeate
prouided for that purpoſe, boweth downe
his head towardes the ground, and ſayeth
this prayer: Oh Lord God King of Kinges,
Lord of Lordes, which by thy prophet Samuel
diddeſt chooſe thy ſeruant Dauid, and annoint
him for King ouer thy people Iſraell, heare now
our prayers, and looke from thy ſanctuarie vpon
this thy ſeruant Theodore, whome thou haſt
choſen and exalted for King ouer theſe thy holy
Nations, annoint him with the oyle of gladneſſe,

protect him by thy power, put vpon his
head a crowne of golde and pretious ſtones, giue
him length of dayes, place him in the ſeate of
Iuſtice, ſtrengthen his arme, make ſubiect vnto
him all the barbarous nations. Lette thy
feare bee in his whole heart, turne him from an
euill faith, and from all errour, and ſhewe him
the ſaluation of thy holy and vniuerſall Church,
that hee may iudge thy people with Iuſtice, and
protect the children of the poore, and finally atteyne
euerlaſting lyfe. This prayer hee ſpeaketh
with a lowe voyce, and then pronounceth
a lowde: All prayſe and power to God
the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. The
prayer beyng ended, hee commaundeth certaine
Abbots to reach the imperiall roabe
and cappe: whiche is done verie decently,
and with great ſolemnitie, the Patriarch withall
pronouncing alowde: Peace be vnto all.
And ſo he beginneth an other praier to this
effect: Bowe your ſelues together with vs, and
pray to him that reigneth ouer all. Preſerue him
(oh Lord) vnder thy holy protection, keepe him
that hee may doo good and holy things, let
iuſtice ſhine foorth in his dayes, that wee may
liue quietly without ſtrife and malice. This is
pronounced ſomewhat ſoftly by the Patriarch,
whereto hee addeth againe alowd:
Thou art the King of the whole worlde, and
the ſauiour of our ſoules, to thee the Father,

Sonne and Holy ghoſt, be all prayſe for euer,
and euer, Amen. Then putting on the roabe
and the cappe, he bleſſeth the Emperour with the
ſigne of the croſſe: ſaying withall, in the name
of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy ghoſt.
The like is done by the Metropolites, Archbiſhops,
and Biſhops: who all in their order
come to the chaire, and one after an other
bleſſe the Emperour with their two forefingers.
Then is ſayed by the Patriarch an
other prayer, that beginneth: O moſt holy
virgin mother of God, &amp;c. After which a Deacon
pronounceth with an high lowde voice:
Many yeares to Noble Theodore, good, honourable,
beloued of God, great Duke of Volodemer
of Mosko, Emperour, and Monarch of all
Ruſsia, &amp;c. Whereto the other Prieſtes and
Deacons that ſtand ſomewhat farre of by
the altar or table, anſweare ſinging: Many
yeares, many yeares, to the noble Theodore.
The ſame not is taken vp by the Prieſtes
and Deacons, that are placed at the right
and left ſide of the Church, and then all together,
they chaunt and thunder out, ſinging:
Many yeares to the noble Theodore, good,
honaurable, beloued of God, great Duke of Volodemer,
Mosko, Emperour of all Ruſsia, &amp;c.
Theſe ſolemnities beyng ended, firſt commeth
the Patriarch with the Metropolites.
Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, then the Nobilitie,

and the whole companie in their order,
to doo homage to the Emperour, bending
downe their heads and knocking them at
his feete to the very ground.
            
               The ſtile wherewith he is inueſted
at his Coronation, runneth
after this manner.
               THeodore Iuanowich, by the grace of God
great Lord and Emperour of all Ruſsia,
great Duke of Volodemer, Mosko, and Nouograd,
King of Cazan, King of Aſtracan, Lord
of Plesko, and great duke of Smolensko, of Twerria,
Ioughoria, Permia, Vadska, Bulghoria,
and others, Lord and great duke of Nouograd
of the Low countrie, of Chernigo, Rezan, Polotskoy,
Roſtoue, Yaruflaueley, Bealozera, Liefland,
Oudoria, Obdoria, and Condenſa, Commaunder
of all Siberia, and of the North partes,
and Lord of many other Countries, &amp;c.
               This ſtile conteyneth in it all the Emperours
Prouinces, and ſetteth foorth his
greatneſſe. And therefore they haue a great
delight and pride in it, forcing not onely
there owne people but alſo ſtraungers (that
haue any matter to deliuer to the Emperour
by ſpeach or writing) to repeate the
whole forme from the beginning to the end,
Which breedeth much cauill, and ſometimes

quarrell betwixt them and the Tartar,
and Poland Ambaſſadours: who refuſe to
call him Czar, that is Emperour, and to repeat
the other partes of his long ſtile. My
ſelfe when I had audience of the Emperour,
thought good to ſalute him onely with thus
much vz. Emperour of all Ruſſia, great Duke
of Volodemer, Mosko and Nouograd, King
of Cazan, King of Aſtracan. The reſt I omitted
of purpoſe, becauſe I knew they gloried,
to haue their ſtile appeare to bee of a
larger volume then the Queenes of England.
But this was taken in ſo ill part, that
the Chauncellor (who then attended the Emperour,
with the reſt of the Nobilitie) with a
lowde chafing voice called ſtill vpon mee to
ſay out the reſt. Whereto I anſwered, that
the Emperours ſtile was very long, and could
not ſo well be remembred by ſtraungers,
that I had repeated ſo much of it, as might
ſhewe that I gaue honour to the reſt &amp;c:
But all would not ſerue till I commaunded
my Interpreter to
ſay it all out.
            
         
         
            
            The State or forme of their
Gouernment.
            The 7. Chapter.
            
               THe manner of their gouernment
is much after the Turkiſh
faſhiō: which they ſeeme
to imitate as neare as the coū
               trie,
and reach of their capacities
in pollitique affayres
will giue them leaue to doo.
            The State and forme of their gouernment
is plaine tyrannicall,The Ruſſe gouernment tyrannicall. as applying all to the
behoofe of the Prince, and that after a moſt
open and barbarous manner: as may appeare
by the Sophiſmata or ſecretes of their
gouernment afterwards ſet downe, aſwell
for the keeping of the Nobilitie and Commons
in an vnder proportion, &amp; far vneuen
ballance in their ſeuerall degrees, as alſo
in their impoſitions and exactions, wherein
they exceede all iuſt meaſure without any
regard of Nobilitie or people: farther then
it giueth the Nobilitie a kinde of iniuſt and
vnmeaſured libertie, to commaund and exact
vpon the commons and baſer ſort of people
in all partes of the realme where ſoeuer
they come, ſpecially in the place where their

landes lye, or where they are appoynted
by the Emperonr to gouerne vnder him.
Alſo to the Commons ſome ſmall contentment,
in that they paſſe ouer their landes
by diſcent of inheritance to whither ſonne
they will: which commonly they doo after
our Gauillkinde, and diſpoſe of their goods
by gifte or Teſtament without any controlment.
Wherein notwithſtanding both Nobilitie
and Commons are but ſtoarers for
the Prince, all running in the ende into the
Emperours coffers: as may appeare by the
practiſe of enriching his treaſurie, and the
manner of exactions ſet downe in the title
of his cuſtomes, and reuenues.
            Concerning the principall pointes and
matters of State, wherein the Soueraintie
conſiſteth (as the making and annulling of publike
Lawes, the making of Magiſtrates, power
to make warre or league with any forraine State,
to execute or to pardon life, with the right of
appeale in all matters, both ciuill and criminall)
they doo ſo wholy and abſolutely pertaine
to the Emperour, and his Counſell vnder
him, as that hee may be ſaide to be both
the Soueraine commaunder, and the executioner
of all theſe. For as touching any
Lawe or publique order of the Realme, it
is euer determined of before any publique
aſſemblie or Parliament bee ſummoned.

Where beſides his Councell, hee hath none
other to conſult with him of ſuch matters as
are concluded before hand, but onely a fewe
Biſhops, Abbots, and Friers: to no other
end then to make aduantage of the peoples
ſuperſtitions, euen againſt themſelues, which
thinke all to bee holy and iuſt, that paſſeth
with conſent of their Biſhops and Cleargie
men, whatſoeuer it be. For which purpoſe
the Emperours are content to make much
of the corrupt ſtate of the Church, as now it
is among them, and to nouriſh the ſame by
extraordinarie fauours, and immunities to
the Biſhops ſeas, Abbeies and Frieries: as
knowing ſuperſtition and falſe religion beſt
to agree with a tyrannicall ſtate, and to be
a ſpeciall meanes to vphold and mainteyne
the ſame.
            Secondly, as touching the publike offices
and magiſtracies of the realme, there is none
hereditarie, neither any ſo great nor ſo litle
in that countrie, but the beſtowing of it is
done immediatly by the Emperour himſelf.
Inſomuch that the very Diacks or clearkes
in euery head towne, are for the moſt part
aſsigned by himſelfe. Notwithſtanding, the
Emperour that now is (the better to entend
his deuotions) referreth al ſuch matters perteyning
to the State, wholly to the ordering
of his wiues brother, the L. Borris Federowich

Godonoe.
            
            Thirdly, the like is to be ſaid of the iuriſdiction
concerning matters iudiciall, ſpecially
ſuch as concerne life and death.
Wherein there is none that hath anie authoritie
or publike iuriſdiction that goeth
by diſcent, or is held by charter, but all at
the appoyntment and pleaſure of the Emperour,
and the ſame practiſed by the iudges
with ſuch awe and reſtraint, as that they
dare not determine vpon anie ſpeciall matter,
but muſt referre the ſame wholly, vp
to the Mosko to the Emperours Councell.
To ſhewe his Soueraintie ouer the liues
of his ſubiects, the late Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich
in his walkes or progreſſes, if hee had
miſliked the face or perſon of any man whō
hee met by the way, or that looked vpon
him, would command his head to be ſtrook
off. Which was preſently done, and the head
caſt before him.
            Fourthly, for the ſoueraigne appeale, and
giuing of pardons in criminall matters to
ſuch as are conuicted, it is wholly at the
pleaſure and grace of the Emperour. Wherin
alſo the Empreſſe that nowe is, being a
woman of great clemencie, and withall delighting
to deale in publike affaires of the
Realme, (the rather to ſupply the defect of
her husband) doeth behaue her ſelfe after an

abſolute manner, giuing out pardon (ſpecially
on hir byrth, day and other ſolemne
times) in her owne name, by open proclamation,
without any mention at all of the
Emperour. Some there haue beene of late
of the auncient Nobilitie, that haue held
diuers prouinces by right of inheritaunce,
with an abſolute authoritie and iuriſdiction
ouer them, to order and determine all matters
within their owne precinct without all
appeale, or controlment of the Emperour.
But this was all annulled and wrung cleane
from them by Iuan Vaſilowich father to this
Emperour.
         
         
            The manner of holding their Parliaments.
            The 8. Chapter.
            
               THeir higheſt Court of publike
conſultation for matter
of State,The States of Parliament. is called the Zabore,
that is, the Publike Aſſembly.
The ſtates &amp; degrees of perſons
that are preſent at their
Parliaments, are theſe in order. 1. The Emperour
himſelfe. 2. Some of his Nobilitie about
the number of twentie being all of his
Councel. 3. Certain of the cleargy men, &amp;c.

about the ſame number. As for Burghers or
other to repreſent the cōmunaltie, they haue
no place there: the people being of no better
account with them then as ſeruants or bond
ſlaues that are to obey, not to make lawes,
nor to knowe any thing of publike matters
before they are concluded.
            The Court of Parliament (called Zabore)
is held in this manner.The order of the ſummons or aſſembling. The Emperour cauſeth
to be ſummoned ſuch of his Nobilitie as
himſelfe thinketh meete, being (as was ſaid)
all of his Councell: together with the Patriarch,
who calleth his Cleargie, to wit, the
two Metropolites, the two Archbiſhops,
with ſuch Biſhops, Abbots, and Friers as are
of beſt account and reputation among thē.
When they are all aſſembled at the Emperours
court, the day is intimated when the
ſeſsion ſhal begin. Which commonly is vpon
ſome friday, for the religion of that day.
            When the day is come, the cleargie men
aſſemble before at the time &amp; place appointed,
which is called the Stollie. And when the
Emperour commeth attended by his Nobilitie,
they ariſe all, and meete him in an out
roome, following their Patriarch, who bleſſeth
the Emperor with his two forefingers,
laying them on his forehead, and the ſides
of his face, and then kiſſeth him on the right
ſide of his breſt. So they paſſe on into their

Parliament houſe, where they ſit in this order.
The Emperor is enthronized on the one
ſide of the chamber. In the next place not far
from him at a ſmal ſquare table (that giueth
roome to twelue perſons or thereabouts)
ſitteth the Patriarche with the Metropolites
and Biſhops, and certeine of the principall
Nobilitie of the Emperours Councel,
together with two Diacks or Secretaries (called
Dumnoy dyakey) that enact that which
paſſeth. The reſt place themſelues on benches
round about the roome, euery man in
his ranck after his degree. Then is there propounded
by one of the Secretaries (who repreſenteth
the ſpeaker) the cauſe of their aſſemblie,
and the principall matters that they
are to conſider of. For to propund bils what
euery man thinketh good for the publike benefite
(as the maner is in England) the Ruſſe
Parliament alloweth no ſuch cuſtome, nor
libertie to ſubiects.
            The poynts being opened,Their diſcourſe at Parliamēt. the Patriarch
with his Cleargie men haue the prerogatiue
to be firſt asked their vote, or opinion, what
they thinke of the poyntes propounded by
the Secretarie. Whereto they anſwere in order,
according to their degrees, but al in one
forme without any diſcourſe: as hauing learned
their leſſon before, that ſerueth their
turnes at all Parliaments alike, whatſoeuer is

propounded. Commonly it is to this effect.
That the Emperour and his Councell are of great
wiſedome, and experience, touching the pollicies
and publike affaires of the Realme, and farre better
able to iudge what is profitable for the common
wealth, then they are, which attend vpon the
ſeruice of God onlie, and matters of religion. And
therefore it may pleaſe them to proceede. That
inſteede of their aduiſe, they will aide them with
their prayers, as their dueties and vocations doe
require, &amp;c. To this or like effect hauing
made their anſweres euery man in his courſe,
vp ſtandeth ſome Abbot or Frier more bold
then the reſt (yet appointed before hand as
a matter of forme) and deſireth the Emperour
it would pleaſe his Maieſtie, to commaund
to be deliuered vnto them what his
Maieſties owne iudgement, and determinate
pleaſure is, as touching thoſe matters propounded
by his Deiake.
            
            
               Whereto is replied by the ſaide Secretarie
in the Emperours name. That his Highneſſe
with thoſe of his noble Councell, vpon good
and ſound aduiſe haue found the matters propoſed
to be verie good and neceſſarie for the common
wealth of his Realme. Notwithſtanding,
for aſmuch as they as religious men, &amp; know what
is right, his Maieſtie requireth their godiie opinions,
yea and their cenſures too, for the approuing
or correcting of the ſaide propoſitions. And

therefore deſireth them againe to ſpeake their
mindes freely. And if they ſhal like to giue their
conſents, that then the matters may paſſe to a full
concluſion.
            Hereunto when the Cleargie men haue
giuen their conſents (which they vſe to do
without any great pauſing) they take their
leaues with bleſsing of the Emperour: who
bringeth the Patriarch on his way ſo farre as
the next roome, and ſo returneth to his ſeat,
till all be made readie for his returne homeward.
The actes that thus are paſſed by the
Zabore or Parliament, the Deiakeis or Secretaries
draw into a forme of proclamation,
which they ſend abroad into euery Prouince,
and head towne of the Realme, to be publiſhed
there by the Dukes and Diakeis, or Secretaries
of thoſe places. The ſeſsion of
Parliament being fully ended, the Emperour
inuiteth the Cleargie men to
a ſolemne dinner. And ſo they depart
euery man to his
home.
         
         
            
            Of the Nobilitie, and by what meanes it is
kept in an vnder proportion agreeable
to to that State.
            The 9. Chapter.
            
               THe degrees of perſons or
eſtates of Ruſſia,
               The Vdelney Knazey chiefe of the Nobilitie, beſides
the ſoueraigne State or
Emperour himſelfe) are
theſe in their order. 1. The
Nobilitie which is of foure
ſortes. Whereof the chiefe
for birth, authoritie, and reuenue are called
the Vdelney Knazey, that is, the exempt or
priuiledged Dukes. Theſe held ſometime a
ſeueral iuriſdiction, and abſolute authorite
within their precincts, much like vnto the
States or Nobles of Germany. But afterwards
(reſeruing their rights vpon compoſition)
they yeelded themſelues to this houſe of Beala,
when it began to waxe mightie, and to
enlarge it ſelf by ouermatching their neighbours.
Onely they were bound to ſerue the
Emperour in his warres with a certain number
of horse. But the late Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich
father to this prince, being a man of
high ſpirit, and ſubtill in his kind meaning
to reduce his gouernmēt into a more ſtrickt

forme beganne by degrees to clip of their
greatnes, &amp; to bring it downe to a leſſer proportion:
till in the end he made them not
onely his vaſſals, but his Kolophey, that is, his
very villains or bōdſlaues. For ſo they terme
and write themſelues in anie publike inſtrument
or priuate petition which they
make to the Emperour. So that now they
holde their authorities, landes, liues and
all at the Emperours pleaſure, as the reſt
doe.
            The meanes and practiſe whereby hee
wrought this to effect againſt thoſe, &amp; other
of the Nobility (ſo well as I could note out
of the report of his doings) were theſe, and
ſuch like. Firſt, he caſt priuate emulations
among them about preroragatiue of their
titles, and dignities. Wherein hee vſed to
ſet on the inferiours, to preferre or equall
themſelues to thoſe that were accounted to
bee of the nobler houſes. Where he made
his aduanntage of their malice and contentions,
the one againſt the other, by receiuing
deuiſed matter, and accuſations of
ſecrete practiſe and conſpiracies to be intended
againſt his perſon, and ſtate. And
ſo hauing ſingled out the greateſt of them,
and cut them off with the good liking of
the reſt, hee fell at laſt to open practiſe,
by forcing of the other to yeeld their rights

vnto him.
            2 Hee deuided his ſubiectes into two
partes or factions by a general ſchiſme.The factiō of Oppreſſini &amp; Zempskey deuiſed by the Emperour. The
one part hee called the Oppreſſini or Select
men. Theſe were ſuch of the Nobilitie and
Gentrie as he tooke to his owne part to protect
and mainteyne them as his faithful ſubiects.
The other hee called Zemskey, or the
Commons. The Zemskey conteyned the baſe
and vulgar ſort, with ſuch Noblemen and
Gentlemen as he meant to cut off, as ſuſpected
to miſlike his gouernment, and to haue
a meaning to practiſe againſt him. Wherein
he prouided that the Oppreſſini for number
and qualitie of valure, money, armour, &amp;c:
farre exceeded the other of the Zempskey
ſide, whom he put (as it were) from vnder his
protection: ſo that if any of them were ſpoiled
or killed by thoſe of the Oppreſſini (which
hee accounted of his owne part) there was
no amendes to bee ſought for by way of
publike iuſtice, or by complaint to the Emperour.
            The whole number of both partes was
orderly regiſtred and kept in a booke: ſo
that euery man knewe who was a Zempskey
man, and who of the Oppreſſini. And this libertie
of the one part to ſpoyle and kill the
other without anie helpe of Magiſtrate, or
lawe (that continued ſeuen yeeres) enriched

that ſide, and the Emperours treaſurie, and
wrought that withall which hee intended
by this practiſe, viz. to take out of the way
ſuch of the Nobilitie, as himſelf miſliked:
whereof were ſlayne within one weeke to
the number of three hundred within the
citie of Mosko. This tyrannicall practiſe
of making a generall Schiſme, and publike
diuiſion among the ſubiects of his whole
Realme, proceeded (as ſhould ſeeme) from
an extreame doubt, and deſperate feare,
which hee had conceiued of moſt of his Nobilitie,
and Gentlemen of his Realme, in his
warres with the Polonian and Chrim Tartar.
What time hee grewe into a vehement
ſuſpition (conceiued of the ill ſucceſſe of
his affayres) that they practiſed treaſon with
the Polonian and Chrim. Whereupon he executed
ſome, and deuiſed this way to be ridde
of the reſt.
            And this wicked pollicy &amp; tyrannous practiſe
(though now it be ceaſſed) hath ſo troubled
that countrey, and filled it ſo full of
grudge &amp; mortall hatred euer ſince, that it
wil not be quenched (as it ſeemeth now) till
it burne againe into a ciuill flame.
            3 Hauing thus pulled them and ſeaſed
all their inheritaunce, landes, priuiledges,
&amp;c. ſaue ſome verie ſmall part which
he left to their name, hee gaue them other

landes of the tenour of Pomeſtnay (as they
call it) that are helde at the Emperours
pleaſure, lying farre of in an other countrey,
and ſo remoued them into other of
his Prouinces, where they might haue
neyther fauour, nor authoritie, not being
natiue nor well knowen there. So that now
theſe of the chiefe Nobilitie (called Vdelney
Knazey) are equalled with the reſt: ſaue
that in the opinion and fauour of the people
they are of more account, and keepe ſtil the
prerogatiue of their place in al their publike
meetings.
            Their practiſe to keepe downe theſe
houſes from riſing againe and recouering
their dignities are theſe, and ſuch like. Firſt,
many of their heires are kept vnmaried perforce
that the ſtocke may die with thē Some
are ſent into Siberia, Cazan and Aſtracan,
vnder pretence of ſeruice, and there either
made away, or elſe faſt clapped vp. Some are
put into Abbeyes, and ſhire themſelues Friers
by pretence of a vowe to be made voluntary,
and of their owne accord, but indeede
forced vnto it by feare, vpon ſome pretenſed
crime obiected againſt them. Where they
are ſo garded by ſome of ſpecial truſt, and the
Couent it ſelfe (vpon whoſe head it ſtandeth
that they make no eſcape) as that they
haue no hope but to ende their liues there.

Of this kinde there are manie of verie
great Nobilitie. Theſe and ſuch like wayes
begunne by the Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich
are ſtill practiſed by the Godonoes, who
beyng aduaunced by the mariage of the
Empreſſe their kinſewoman, rule both the
Emperour, and his Realme, (ſpecially Borris
Federowich Godonoe, brother to the Empreſſe)
and endeuour by all meanes to cut
of, or keepe downe all of the beſt and auncienteſt
Nobilitie. Whereof diuers alreadie
they haue taken away, whom they thought
likelieſt to make head againſt them and to
hinder their purpoſe, as Knez Andreas Guraken
Bulgatkoue, a man of great byrth
and authoritie in the Countrey. The like
they haue done with Peeter Gollanni (whom
they put into a dungeon where he ended
his life) with Knez Vaſilie Vrywich Golloohen,
with Andrieu luanowich Suskoy accounted
among them for a man of a great wiſedome.
So this laſt yeere was killed in a Monaſterie,
(whither they had thruſt him)
on Knez Iuan Petrowich Suskoy a man of
great valure, and ſeruice in that Countrey:
who about fiue or ſixe yeeres ſince, bare out
the ſiege of the Citie Vobsko made by Stepan
Batore King of Polonia, with a 100000.
men, and repulſed him verie valiantly, with
great honour to himſelfe, and his countrey,

and diſgrace to the Polonian. Alſo Mitheta
Romanowich vnckle to the Emperour by the
mothers ſide, was ſuppoſed to haue dyed of
poyſon, or ſome like practiſe.
            The names of theſe families of greateſt
Nobility are theſe in their order.Names of the greateſt houſes of the Ruſſe Nobilitie. The firſt is
of Knez Volodemer, which reſteth at this time
in one daughter a widow, and without children
(mentioned before) ſometime wife to
Hartock Magnus brother to the king of Denmark,
now cloſed within a trūnery. The 2. knez
Metheloskey thruſt into a Friery, and his only
ſonne kept frō mariage, to decay the houſe.
The 3. Glimskoy. But one left of his houſe, &amp;
he without children ſaue one daughter. The
4. Suskoy, wherof there are 4. brethren yong
men, &amp; vnmaried al. The 5. Hubetskoy. Of this
houſe are 4. liuing. The 6. Bulgaloy now called
Guletchey houſe, whereof are fiue liuing, but
youths al. The 7. Vorallinskoy. Two left of that
ſtock. The 8. Odgoskey. Two. The 9. Telletskoy.
One. The 10. Taytoue, three. Theſe are the
names of the chiefe families called Vdelney
Knazey: that in effect haue loſt all now, ſaue
the very name it ſelfe, and fauour of the people,
which is like one day to reſtore them againe,
if any be left.
            The 2. degree of Nobility is of the Boiarens.
               The 2. degree of Nobilitie.
Theſe are ſuch as the Emperour honoureth
(beſides their nobility) with the title of counſellers.

The reuenue of theſe 2. ſorts of their
Nobles that riſeth out of their lands aſsigned
thē by the Emperour, &amp; held at his pleaſure
(for of their owne inheritaunce there is little
left them as was ſaid before) is about a thouſand
marks a yeere: beſides penſion which
they receiue of the Emperour for their ſeruice
in his warres, to the ſumme of 700. rubbels
a yeere, and none aboue that ſumme.
            But in this number the lorde Borris Federowich
Godenoe is not to be reckoned, that
is like a Tranſendent, and in no ſuch predicament
with the reſt, being the Emperors brother
in law, his protectour for direction, for
commaund and authority Emperour of Ruſſia.
His yerely reuenue in land &amp; penſion, amounteth
to the ſumme of 93700. rubbels
and more, as appeareth by the particulars.
He hath of inheritance (which himſelfe hath
augmentēted in Vaſma Dorogoboſe ſixe thouſand
rubbels a yeere. For his office of Connick,
or Maſter of the Horſe 12000. rubbels,
or markeſ, raiſed out of the Conaſlue
Sloboday, or the liberties pertayning to that
Office, which are certeyne Landes and
Townes neere about the Mosko. Beſides,
all the meddowe and paſture grounde on
both ſides the banke of the riuer Mosko,
thirtie verſt vp the ſtreame, aod fourtie verſt
downwards. For his penſion of the Emperour

(beſides the other for his office) 15000.
rubbels. Out of the Prouince or Shire of
Vagha, there is giuen him for a peculiar exempted
out of the Chetfird of Poſolskoy
32000. rubbels, beſides a tent of furres.
Out of Rezan and Seuer, (an other peculiar)
30000. rubbels. Out of Otfer and Turiock
an other exempt place 8000. rubbels.
For rent of Bathſtoaues and Bathing houſes
without the walles of Mosko 1500. rubbels.
Beſides his pomeſt, or lands which hee
holdeth at the Emperours pleaſure, which
farre exceedeth the proportion of land allotted
to the reſt of the Nobility.
            One other there is of the houſe of
Glinskoy that diſpendeth in land and penſion
about 40000. rubbels yeerely. Which hee is
ſuffered to enioy becauſe hee hath married
Borris his wiues ſiſter, being himſelfe verie
ſimple, and almoſt a naturall. The ordering
of him &amp; his landes are committed to Borris.
            
            In the third rank are the Voyauodey or ſuch
Nobles as are,The 3. ſort of Nobilitie. or haue bin generals in the Emperours
warres. Which deliuer the honour
of their title to their poſterities alſo: who
take their place aboue the other Dukes and
Nobles that are not of the two former
ſort, vz. of the Vdelney knazey, nor of the Boiarens.
            
            Theſe three degrees of their Nobilitie (to

wit) the Vdelney knazey, the Boiarens, and
the Voiaudey haue the addition of vich, put
vnto their ſirname as Borris Federowich, &amp;c:
which is a note of honour that the reſt may
not vſurpe. And in caſe it be not added in
the naming of them, they may ſue the Beſtcheſt
or penaltie of diſhonour vpon them,
that otherwiſe ſhall terme them.
            The fourth and loweſt degree of Nobilitie
with them, is of ſuch as beare the name of
Knazey or Dukes, but come of the yonger
brothers of thoſe chiefe houses, through many
diſcents, and haue no inheritance of their
owne, ſaue the bare name or title of Duke
onely. For their order is to deliuer their
names and titles of their dignities ouer to all
their children alike, what ſoeuer elſe they
leaue them. So that the ſonnes of a Voiauodey
or Generall in the field, are called Voiauodey
though they neuer ſaw the field, and the ſons
of a Knez or Duke are called Knazey though
they haue not one groat of inheritance or
liuelyhood to mainteine themſelues withall.
Of this ſort there are ſo many that the plentie
maketh them cheap: ſo that you ſhall ſee
Dukes glad to ſerue a meane man for fiue or
ſix rubbels or marks a yeare, &amp; yet they will
ſtand highly vpon their Beſtcheſt or reputation
of their Honours. And theſe are their
ſeuerall degrees of Nobilitie.
            
               
The ſecond degree of perſons is of their
Sina Boiarskey,
               The ſecond degree of perſons. or the ſonnes of Gentlemen:
which all are preferred, &amp; hold that name by
their ſeruice in the Emperours warres, being
ſouldiers by their very ſtocke and birth. To
which order are referred their Dyacks or
Secretaries, that ſerue the Emperour in euery
head towne, being ioyned in Commiſsion
with the Dukes of that place
            The laſt are their Commons,The third degree. whom they
call Mouſicks. In which number they reckon
their Marchants, &amp; their common artificers.
The very loweſt and baſeſt ſort of this kind
(which are held in no degree) are their coū
               trie
people whom they call Chriſtianeis. Of
the Sina boiarskey (which are all ſouldiers) we
are to ſee in the deſcription of their forces, &amp;
military prouiſions. Concerning their Mouſicks,
what their condition &amp; behauiour is, in
the title or chapter Of the common people.
            
         
         
            Of the gouernment of their Prouinces
and Shires.
            The 10. Chapter.
            
               THe whole countrie of Ruſſia (as
was ſaid before) is diuided into
foure parts, which they call Chetfirds,
or Tetrarchies. Euery Chetfird
               
cōteineth diuers ſhires, &amp; is annexed to a ſeuerall
office, whereof it takes the name. The
firſt Chetfird or Tetrarchie beareth the name
of Poſoskoy Chetfird,
               The foure Chetfirds.
                or the Iuriſdiction of the
office of Ambaſſages, and at this time is vnder
the chiefe Secretarie and officer of the Ambaſſages
called Andreas Shalcaloue. The ſtā
               ding
fee or ſtipend that he receiueth yearely
of the Emperour for this ſeruice, is 100. rubbels
or markes.
            The ſecond is called the Roſeradney Chetfird,
becauſe it is proper to the Roſerade or
high Conſtable. At this time it perteineth by
vertue of office to Baſilie Shalcaloue, brother
to the Chancellor, but it is executed by one
Zapon Abramoue. His penſion is an hundred
rubbels yearely.
            The third is the Chetfird of Pomeſtnoy, as
perteining to that office. This keepeth a Regiſter
of all lands giuen by the Emperour for
ſeruice to his Noblemē, Gentlemē, &amp; others,
giueth out &amp; taketh in all aſſurances for thē.
The officer at this time is called Eleazar welluſgine.
His ſtipend is 500. rubbels a yeare.
            The fourth is called Caſſanskoy dworets, as
being appropriat to the office that hath the
iuriſdiction of the kingdomes of Cazan and
Aſtracan, with the other townes lying vpon
the Volgha, now ordered by one Druzhine
Penteleoue, a man of very ſpeciall account

among them, for his wiſdome, and promptnes
in matters of pollicie. His penſion is 150.
rubbels a yeare.
            From theſe Chetfirds or Tetarchies is exempted
the Emperors inheritance or Vochin
(as they cal it) for that it perteined from auncient
time to the houſe of Beala, which is
the ſirname of the imperiall bloud. This ſtā
               deth
of 36. townes with their bounds or territories.
Beſides diuers peculiar iuriſdictions,
which at likewiſe deducted out of thoſe
Chetfirds, as the Shire of Vagha (belonging
to the Lord Borriſe Federowich Godonoe) and
ſuch like.
            Theſe are the chiefe gouernours or officers
of the Prouinces, not reſident at their
charge abroad, but attending the Emperour
whether ſoeuer he goeth, and carrying their
offices about with them, which for the moſt
part they hold at Mosko, as the Emperours
chiefe ſeat.
            The parts and practiſe of theſe foure offices,
is to receiue all complaints and actions
what ſoeuer, that are brought out of their
ſeuerall Chetfirds, and quarters, &amp; to informe
them to the Emperours counſell. Likewiſe
to ſend direction again to thoſe that are vnder
them in their ſaid Prouinces, for all matters
giuen in charge by the Emperour and
his Counſell, to be done or put in execution

within their precincts.
            For the ordering of euery particular
Prouince of theſe foure Chetfirds, there is appointed
one of theſe Dukes, which were reckoned
before in the loweſt degree of their
Nobilitie, which are reſident in the head
townes of the ſaid Prouinces. Whereof euery
one hath ioyned with him in Commiſsion
a Dyack or Secretarie to aſsiſt him, or rather
to direct him. For in the executing of their
commiſsion, the Dyack doth all.
            The parts of their Commiſsion are theſe
in effect.The Commiſsion of the Dukes or Preſidents of Shires. Firſt to heare and determine in all
ciuil matters within their precinct To which
purpoſe they haue vnder them certeine officers,
as Gubnoy Starets or Coroners, who beſides
the triall of ſelfe murders, are to attach
fellons: and the Souldiae or vnder Iuſtices, who
themſelues alſo may heare and determine in
all matters of the ſame nature, among the
countrie people of their owne wardes or
bayliwicks: but ſo that in caſe either partie
diſſent, they may appeale, and goe farther to
the Duke and Dyack that reſide within the
head towne. From whom alſo they may remoue
the matter to the higher court at Mosko
of the Emperours Counſell, where lie all
appeales. They haue vnder them alſo Sotſkoy
Starets, that is Aldermen, or Baliues of
the hundreds.
            
               
Secondly in all criminall matters, as theft,
murder, treaſon, &amp;c. they haue authoritie to
apprehend, to examine and to empriſon the
malefactor, and ſo hauing receiued perfect euidence
&amp; information of the cauſe, they are
to ſend it ready drawen and orderly digeſted
vp to the Mosko, to the officer of the Chetfird,
whereunto that Prouince is annexed: by
whom it is referred and propounded to the
Emperours Counſell. But to determine in any
matter criminall, or to doo executiō vpon
the partie offending, is more then their commiſsion
will allow them to doo.
            Thirdly, if there be any publike ſeruice to
be done within that Prouince, (as the publiſhing
of any Law, or common order, by way
of proclamation, collecting of taxes and impoſitions
for the Emperour, moiſtering of
Souldiers, and ſending them forth at the day
and to the place aſsigned by the Emperour
or his Counſell) all theſe and ſuch like perteyne
to their charge.
            Theſe Dukes &amp; Dyacks are appointed to
their place by the Emperour himſelfe &amp; are
chaunged ordinarily at euery yeares end, except
vpō ſome ſpecial liking or ſuit, the time
be proroged for a yeare or two more. They
are men of themſelues of no credite, nor fauour
with the people, where they gouerne,
being neither borne, nor brought vp among

them, not yet hauing inheritance of their
owne there, or els where. Onely of the Emperour
they haue for that ſeruice an 100.
markes a yeare, he that hath moſt, ſome fiftie,
ſome but thirtie. Which maketh them
more ſuſpected &amp; odious to the people, becauſe
being ſo bare, and comming freſh and
hungrie vpon them lightly euery yeare, they
rack &amp; ſpoile them without all regard of iuſtice,
or conſcience. Which is eaſily tollerated
by the chiefe officers of the Chetfirds, to the
end they may rob them againe &amp; haue a better
bootie when they call them to account:
which cōmonly they doo at the end of their
ſeruice, making an aduātage of their iniuſtice
&amp; oppreſsion ouer the poore people. There
are few of them but they come to the Pudkey
or whip when their time is ended, which
themſelues for the moſt parte doo make account
of. And therefore they furniſh themſelues
with all the ſpoile they can for the time
of their gouernment, that they may haue
for both turnes, aſwel for the Emperour, and
Lord of the Chetfird, as to reſerue ſome good
part for themſelues.
            They that are appointed to gouerne abroad,
are men of this qualitie: ſaue that in
the foure border townes that are of greateſt
importance, are ſet men of more ſpeciall
valure and truſt two in euery towne. Wherof

one is euer of the Emperours priuie counſell.
Theſe foure border townes are Smolensko,
Vobsko, Nouogrod, &amp; Cazan, whereof three
lie towards the Polonian &amp; Sweden, one bordereth
far of vpon the Chrim Tartar. Theſe
haue larger cōmiſsion then the other Dukes
of the Prouinces that I ſpake of before, and
may doo execution in criminall matters.
Which is thought behoofull for the Commonwelth:
for incident occaſions that may
happen vpon the borders▪ that are far of, &amp;
may not ſtay for direction, about euery occurrent
and particular matter from the Emperour
and his Counſell. They are chaunged
euery yeare (except as before) and haue for
their ſtipend 700. rubbels a yeare hee that
hath moſt: ſome haue but 400▪ Many of theſe
places that are of greateſt importance, &amp; almoſt
the whole countrie is managed at this
time, by the Godonoes and their clients.
            The citie of Mosko (that is the Emperours
ſeat) is gouerned altogether by the Emperours
Counſell. All matters there both ciuill
and criminall, are heard and determined in
the ſeuerall courtes, held by ſome of the ſaid
Counſell, that reſide there all the yeare long.
            Onely for their ordinary matters (as buildings,The Gouernment of Mosko.
               
reparations, keeping of their ſtreates
decent and cleane, collections, leuying of
taxes, impoſitions and ſuch like) are appointed,

two Gentlemen, &amp; two Dyacks or Secretaries,
who hold a court together for the ordering
of ſuch matters. This is called the
Zempskey houſe. If any townes man ſuſpect
his ſeruant of theft or like matter, hither
he may bring him to haue him examined
vpon the Pudkey, or other torture. Beſides
theſe two Gentlemen, and Secretaries
that order the whole Citie, there are Staruſts
or Aldermen for euerie ſeuerall companie.
The Alderman hath his Sotskey or
Conſtable, and the Conſtable hath certeine
Decetskeis or Decurions vnder him, which
haue the ouerſight of ten houſholds a peece,
whereby euerie diſorder is ſooner ſpide, and
the common ſeruice hath the quicker diſpach.
The whole number of Citizens poore
and rich are reduced into companies. The
chiefe officers (as the Dyacks and Gentlemen)
are appointed by the Emperour himſelfe,
the Staruſt by the Gentlemen and Dyacks,
the Sotskoy by the Staruſt or Alderman,
and the Decetskoies by the Conſtables.
            This manner of gouernment of their Prouinces
and townes, if it were aſwell ſet for
the giuing of iuſtice indifferently to al ſorts,
as it is to preuent innouations, by keeping
of the Nobilitie within order, and the commons
in ſubiection, it might ſeeme in that
kinde to bee no bad nor vnpollitique way,

for the conteyning of ſo large a Common-wealth,
of that breadth and length as is the
kingdome of Ruſſia. But the oppreſſion
and ſlauerie is ſo open, and ſo great, that a
man would maruell how the Nobilitie and
people ſhoulde ſuffer themſelues to bee
brought vnder it, while they had any means
to auoid and repulſe it or being ſo ſtrengthned
as it is at this preſent, how the Emperours
themſelues can be content to practiſe
the ſame, with ſo open iniuſtice and oppreſſion
of their ſubiects, being themſelues of a
Chriſtian profeſsion.
            By this it appeareth how harde a matter
it were to alter the ſtate of the Ruſſe gouernment,An harde matter to alter the State of Ruſſia.
               
as now it ſtandeth. Firſt, becauſe
they haue none of the Nobilitie able to
make head. As for the Lords of the foure
Chetfirds or Tetrarchies they are men of no
Nobilitie, but Dyacks aduanced by the Emperour,
depending on his fauour, and attending
onely about his owne perſon. And for
the Dukes that are appointed to gouern vnder
them, they are but men of a titular dignitie
(as was ſaied before) of no power, authoritie,
nor credit, ſaue that which they haue
out of the office, for the time they enioy it.
Which doth purchaſe thē no fauour, but rather
hatred of the people, for aſmuch as they
ſee that they are ſet ouer thē, not ſo much for

any care to doo them right and iuſtice as to
keepe them vnder in a miſerable ſubiection,
and to take the fliece from them, not once in
the yeare (as the owner from his ſheepe) but
to poule and clip them all the yeare long. Beſides
the authority &amp; rule which they beare,
is rent and diuided into many ſmall pieces,
being diuers of them in euery great Shire, limited
beſides with a very ſhort time: which
giueth them no ſcope to make any ſtrength,
nor to contriue ſuch an enterpriſe, if happily
they intended any matter of innouation. As
for the common people (as may better appeare
in the deſcription of their ſtate &amp; qualitie
afterwardes ſet downe) beſides their
want of armour &amp; practiſe of warre (which
they are kept from of purpoſe) they are robbed
continually both of their harts &amp; mony,
(beſides other means) ſomtimes by pretence
of ſome ſeruice to be done for the common
defence, ſometimes without any ſhewe at
all of any neceſsitie of Common-wealth or
Prince. So that there is no meanes either
for Nobilitie, or people to attempt any innouation,
ſo long as the militarie forces of the
Emperour which are the number of 8000. at
the leaſt in continuall pay) hold themſelues
faſt and ſure vnto him, and to the preſent
ſtate. Which needes they muſt doo beyng
of the qualitie of Souldiours, and enioying

withal that free libertie of wronging &amp; ſpoiling
of the commons at their pleaſure, which
is permitted them of purpoſe, to make them
haue a liking of the preſent ſtate. As for the
agreement of the Souldiers and commons,
it is a thing not to be feared, beyng of ſo
oppoſite and contrarie practiſe much one to
the other. This deſperate ſtate of things at
home, maketh the people for the moſt part
to wiſhe for ſome forreine inuaſion, which
they ſuppoſe to bee the onely meanes, to rid
them of the heauy yoke of this tyrannous
gouernment.

The matters occurrent which are of
ſtate done within the Realme, are infourmed
them at their ſittings by the Lordes of the
foure Chetfirds, or Tetrarchies. Whereof mention
is made in the Chapter concerning the
Gouernment of their Prouinces. Who bring
in all ſuch letters as they receyue from the

Dukes, Dyacks, Captaines, and other officers
of the Cities, and Caſtels, perteyning to
their ſeuerall quarter or Chetfird, with other
aduertiſements, and informe the Counſell
of them.
            The like is done by the chiefe officer
of euery ſeuerall office of Record: who may
come into the Counſell chamber, and informe
them, as occaſion incident to his office
doth require. Beſides matters of State,
they conſider of many priuate cauſes, informed
by way of ſupplication in very great
numbers. Whereof ſome they intertaine and
determine, as the cauſe or meanes can procure
fauour. Some they ſend to the offices
whereto they perteyne by common course
of Lawe. Their ordinarie dayes for their ſitting,
are mondaies, wenſdaies, and fridayes.
Their time of meeting is commonly ſeuen a
clock in the morning. If there be any extraordinary
occaſion that requireth conſultation
on ſome other day, they haue warning
by the Clarke of the counſell called Dorofcy
Buſhew, who receiueth order from the
Roſerad or high Conſtable of the
realme, to call them together
at the time appointed.

and other rentes
belonging to the Crowne,
there are appoynted diuers
vnder officers, which
deliuer ouer the ſame into
the head treaſurie. The
firſt is the office of Dwoertſoua or Steward
of the houſholde. The ſecond is the office
of the Chetfirds: which I comprehend vnder
one, though it bee diuided into foure ſeuerall
partes, as was ſayd before. The third
is called Bulſha prechode, or the great Income.
            As touching the firſt,The Steward receiuer of the crowne lād rentes. which is the office
of the Steward, it receyueth all the rents
of the Emperours inheritance, or Crowne
lande, whiche they call Vochin. The Vochin
or Crowne lande conteyneth in it 36.
townes with the territories or hundreds
belonging vnto them. Whereof the chiefe
that yeeld the greateſt rents are theſe: Alexandriſca,
Corelska, Otfer, Sloboder, Danielſka,
Moiſalskoy, Chara, Sametska, Strararouſe,

                  
                     •
                  ranſoue, &amp;c. The inhabitants or tenants
of theſe and the other townes, pay ſome rent
money, ſome other rent dueties (called Obrokey)
as certeine Chetfirds, or meaſures of
graine, wheate, rye, barley, oates, &amp;c. or of
other victuall, as Oxen, Sheepe, Swannes,
Geeſe, Hares, Hennes, wild fowle, Fiſh, Hay,
Wood, Honie, &amp;c. Some are bound to ſowe
for the Emperours prouiſion certaine Akers
of ground, and to make the corne ready for
his vſe: hauing for it an allowance of certaine
akers of ground for their owne proper
vſe.
            This prouiſion for the houſhold, ſpecially
of graine ſerued in by the Tenants, is a great
deale more then is ſpent in his houſe, or in
other allowance ſerued out in liuerie, or for
the Emperours honour, called Schalouaney:
for which vſe there is beſtowed very much
both in graine, and other victuall. This ſurplus
of prouiſion is ſold by the Steward to
the beſt hand, and runneth into the Emperours
treaſurie.
            In the time of Iuan Vaſilowich, father to
this Emperour (who kept a more Princely
&amp; bountiful houſe then the Emperour now
doth) this ouerplus of graine, and other incomes
into the Stewardes office, yeelded to
his treaſurie not paſt 60. thouſand rubbels
yeerely, but riſeth now by good huſbanding

of the Steward Gregory Vaſilowich Godonoe,
to 230. thouſand rubbels a yere. And this by
the meanes of the Empreſſe, and her kinred,
ſpecially (Borris Fedorowich Godonoe) that account
it al their owne that runneth into the
Emperors treaſure. Much of this ſurpluſage
that riſeth out of the rent prouiſion, is emploied
to the paimēt of the wages of his houſhold
officers, which are very many attending
at home, and purueying abroad.
            The ſecond office of receipt called the
Chetfirds,
               The office of Chetfird.
                (being deuided into foure ſeuerall
partes, as before was ſayde) hath foure head
officers: which beſides the ordering and
gouernment of the ſhires conteyned within
their ſeuerall Chedfirds, haue this alſo
as a part of their office,Tagla and Podat. to receiue the Tagla
and Podat belonging to the Emperour,
that riſeth out of the foure Chetfirds or
Quarters. The Tagla is a yeerely rent or
impoſition rayſed vpon euery Wite or meaſure
of graine, that groweth within the land,
gathered by ſworne men, and brought into
the office. The Wite conteyneth ſixtie Chetfirds.
Euery Chetfird is three buſhelles Engliſh,
or little leſſe. The Podat is an ordinarie
rent of money impoſed vpon euerie
ſoake, or Hundred within the whole
Realme.
            This Tagla and Podat bring in yeerely

to the Offices of the Chetfirdes a greate
ſumme of money: as may appeare by the
particulars heere ſet downe. The towne
and Prouince of Vobsko, pay yeerely for
Tagla &amp; Podat about 18000. rubbels. Nouogrod
35000. rubbels. Torſhocke &amp; Otfer 8000.
rubbels. Razan 30000. rubbels. Morum
12000. rubbels. Colmigroe and Duyna 8000.
rubbels. Vologda 12000. rubbels. Cazan 18000
rubb. Vſtiug 30000. rubbels. Roſtoue 50000.
The citie of Mosko 40000. rubbels. Sibierskoy
20000. rubbels. Castrome 12000. rubbels.
The totall amounteth to 400000.
rubbels, or markr a yeere, which is brought
in yeerely the firſt day of September, that
is reckoned by them the firſt day of the
yeere.
            The thirde (that is called the Bulſha Prechod,
               The office of Bulcha Prechod or great income.
or great Income) receyueth all the
cuſtomes that are gathered out of all the
priucipall townes and Cities within the
whole Realme. Beſides, the fees and other
dueties which riſe out of diuers ſmaller
Offices, which are all brought into this
office of Bulſha Prechod. The townes of
moſte trade that doe yeelde greateſt cuſtome,
are theſe heere ſette downe. Mosko,
Smolensko, Vobsko, Nouogrod Velica,
Strararouſe, Torſhocke, Otfer, Yaruſlaue, Caſtrome,
Neſna Nouogrod, Cazan, Vologda. This

cuſtome out of the great townes is therefore
more certaine, and eaſie to be reckoned, becauſe
it is ſet and rated preciſely what they
ſhal pay for the cuſtome of the yeere Which
needes muſt bee paide into the ſaide office,
though they receiue not ſo much. If it fal out
to be more, it runneth al into the Emperours
aduantage.
            The cuſtome at Mosko for euerie yeere,The Emperours cuſtome. is
12000. rubbels. The cuſtome of Smolensko,
8000. Vobsko 12000. rubbels. Nouogrod velica
6000. rubbels. Stararouſe by ſalt and other
commodities 18000. rubbels. Torſhock 800.
rubbels. Otfer 700. rubbels. Yarusſlaue 1200
rubbels. Caſtrome 1800. rubbels. Neſna Nouogrod
7000. rubbels. Cazan 11000. rubbels.
Vologda 2000. rubbels. The cuſtome
of the reſt that are townes of trade, is ſometimes
more, ſometimes leſſe as their traffike,
and dealings with commodities too and fro,
falleth out for the yeere.
            This may bee ſaide for certaine,The whole receipt of the Bulſha Prechod or great income. that the
three tables of receipts belonging to this office
of Bulſha Prechod, when they receiue
leſt, account for thus much, vz. The firſt table
160000. rubbels. The ſecond table 90000.
rubbels. The third 70000. rubbels. So that
there commeth into the office of Bulſha Prechod,
at the leaſt reckoning (as appeareth by
their bookes of cuſtoms) out of theſe and other

townes, and maketh the ſumme of
340000. rubbles a yeere. Beſides this cuſtome
out of the townes of trade, there is
receiued by this office of Bulſha Prechod, the
yeerely rent of the common Bathſtoaues, &amp;
Cabacks or drinking houſes, which pertein
to the Emperour, Which (though it be vncertaine
for the iuſt ſumme, yet becauſe it
is certaine and an ordinary matter, that the
Ruſſe wil bath himſelfe aſwel within as without)
yeeldeth a large rent to the Emperours
treaſurie.
            There is beſides,Rents out of the iudicial offices. a certeine mulct or penaltie
that groweth to the Emperour out of
euery iudgement, or ſentence that paſſeth in
any of his courts of Record in all ciuill matters.
This penaltie, or mulct is 20. Dingoes or
pence vpon euery rubble or marke, and ſo
ten in the hundred. Which is paide by the
partie that is conuict by lawe. Hee hath beſides
for euery name conteyned in the writs
that paſſe out of theſe courts, fiue Alteens.
An Alteen is fiue pence ſterling, or there abouts.
This is made good out of the office,
whence the writ is taken foorth. Thence it
goeth to the office that keepeth the leſſer
ſeale, where it payeth as much more to the
Emperours vſe. This riſeth commonly to
3000. rubbels a yeere, or thereabouts. Farther
alſo out of the office of Roiſbonia, where

all fellonies are tried, is receiued for the Emperour
the halfe part of fellons goodes the
other halfe goeth the one part to the informer,
the other to the officers.
            All this is brought into the office of Bulſha
Prechod, or great income. Beſides the ouerplus
or remainder that is ſaued out of the
land rents, allotted to diuers other offices: as
namely to the office called Roſerade, which
hath landes and rentes aſsigned vnto it to
pay the yeerely ſalaries of the ſouldiers, or
horſemen, that are kept ſtill in pay. Which
in time of peace when they reſt at home not
employed in anie ſeruice, is commonly
cut off and payde them by halfes, ſometimes
not the halfe: ſo that the remainder
out of the Roſerade Office that is layde
into the Emperours treaſurie, commeth for
the moſt part euerie yeere to 250000. rubbels.
            In like ſort (though not ſo much) is
brought in the ſurplus out of the Strelletskoy
offices which hath proper lands for the
payment of the Strelſey men or gunners, aſwell
thoſe at Mosko, that are of the Emperors
gard (12000. in ordinary) as on the borders,
and other garriſon townes and caſtels.
Likewiſe out of the office of Prechaſe, Shiſiuoy
Nemſhoy which hath ſet allowance of
landes to mainteine the forreyne mercenarie

ſouldiers, as Poles, Sweadens, Doutches,
Scots, &amp;c. So out of the office of Puſharskoy,
(which hath lands and rents allowed for the
prouiſion of munition, great Ordinance, powder,
Shot, Salpeeper, Brimſtone, Ledde, and
ſuch like) there is left ſomewhat at the yeres
ende, that runneth into the treaſurie. All
theſe bring into the office of Bulſha Prechod
that which remaineth in their hand at
the yeeres end. Whence it is deliuered into
the Emperours treaſurie. So that the whole
ſumme that groweth to this office of Bulſha
Prechod, or the great income (as appeareth
by the bookes of the ſaid office) amounteth
to 800000. rubbels a yeere, or thereabouts.
            All theſe offices,The Emperours treaſure houſe within his caſtle of Mosko.
                to wit, the office of the

            But beſides this reuenue that is paid all in
money to the Emperours treaſurie he receiueth
yeerely in furres, and other dueties to
a great value out of Siberia, Pechora, Permia,
and other places, which are ſolde or bartred
away for other forreine commodities to the
Turkiſh Perſian, Armenian, Georgian and Bougharian
Marchants that trade within his coū
               tries,
beſides others of Chriſtendome. What
it maketh in the whole (though the value can
not be ſet downe preciſely, as being a thing
caſual as the commodity may be got) it may

be geſſed by that which was gathered the
laſt yeere out of Siberia for the Emperours
cuſtome, vz. 466. timber of Sables, fiue timber
of Martrones, 180. blacke Foxes, beſides
other commodities.
            To theſe may bee added their ſeazures,
and confiſcations vpon ſuch as are in diſpleaſure,
which riſeth to a great ſumme Beſides
other their extraordinary impoſitions,
and exactions done vpon their officers, Monaſteries,
&amp;c. not for any apparant neceſsity
or vſe of the Prince, or common wealth, but
of will and cuſtome: yet with ſome pretence
of a Scythian, that is, groſſe and barbarous
pollicie (as may appeare) by theſe fewe Sophiſmata,
or counterfeit pollicies, put in practiſe
by the Emperours of Ruſſia, all tending
to this end to robbe their people, and to inrich
their treaſurie. To this purpoſe this byword
was vſed by the late Emperour Iuan
Vaſilowich: That his people were like to his beard.
The oftner ſhauen, the thicker it would grow. Or
like ſheepe, that muſt needes be ſhorne once
a yeere at the leasst: to keepe them
from being ouer laden with their
wooll.
            
         
         
            
            Meanes vſed to draw the wealth
of the land into the Emperours
Treaſurie.
            
               TO preuent no extortions exactions,
or briberies whatſoeuer,
done vpon the cōmons by their
Dukes, Diacks, or other officers
in their Prouinces: but to ſuffer them to go
on till their time bee expired, and to ſucke
themſelues ful. Then to cal them to the Praueuſh
(or whippe) for their behauiour, and to
beat out of them all, or the moſt part of the
bootie, (as the honie from the Bee) which
they haue wrung from the commons, and to
turne it into the Emperours treaſurie, but
neuer any thing backe againe to the right
owners, how great or euident ſoeuer the iniurie
be. To this end the needy Dukes, &amp; Diacks,
that are ſent into their prouinces, ſerue
the turne very well, being chaunged ſo often
(to wit) once a yeere: where in reſpect
of their owne, and the qualitie of the people
(as before was ſaid) they might be continued
for ſome longer time, without all feare of innouation.
For comming ſtill freſh vpon the
commons, they ſucke more egerly: like Tiberius
the Emperours flies, that came newe
ſtill vpon all olde ſore. To whome hee was

wont to compare his Praetors, and other prouinciall
officers.
            
               2
               TO make of theſe officers (that haue robbed
their people) ſometimes a publike
example, if any be more notorious then the
reſt: that the Emperour may ſeem to miſlike
the oppreſsions done to his people, &amp; tranſferre
the fault to his ill officers.
               As among diuers other, was done by the
late Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich to a Diack in
one of his Prouinces: that (beſides many other
extortions, and briberies) had taken a
gooſe ready dreſt full of money. The man
was brought to the market place in Mosko.
The Emperour himſelfe preſent made an
Oration. Theſe good people are they that
would eate you vp like bread, &amp;c. Then aſked
hee his Polachies or executioners, who
could cut vp a gooſe, and commaunded one
of them firſt to cut off his legges about the
middes of the ſhinne then his armes aboue
his elbowes (asking him ſtill if gooſe fleſhe
were good meate) in the ende to choppe off
his head: that he might haue the right faſhion
of a gooſe readie dreſſed. This might
ſeeme to haue beene a tollerable piece of iustice
(as iustice goeth in Russia) except his
ſubtill end to couer his owne oppreſſions.
            
            
               
               3
               TO make an open ſhew of want, when anie
great taxe, or impoſition is towards.
As was done by this Emperour Theodore Iuanowich,
by the aduiſe of ſome about him
at the beginning of his reigne: when being
left very rich (as was thought) by his father,
he ſold moſt of his plate, and ſtamped
ſome into coyne: that hee might ſeeme to
want money. Whereupon preſently out
came a taxation.
            
            
               4
               TO ſuffer their ſubiects to giue freely to
the Monaſteries (which for their ſuperſtition
very many doe, ſpecially in their laſt
wils) &amp; to lay vp their money and ſubſtance
in them, to keepe it more ſafe. Which all is
permitted thē without any reſtraint or prouiſo,
as was &amp; is in ſome countries of chriſtē
                  dome.
Whereby their Monaſteries grow to
exceeding great wealth. This they do to haue
the money of the Realme better ſtored together,
and more ready for their hand, when
they liſt to take it. Which manie times is
done without anie noyſe: the Fryers beeyng
content rather to part from ſomewhat (as
the encreaſe groweth) then to looſe all at
once. Which they were made to doubt of in
the other Emperours dayes.
               To this end Iuan Vaſilowich late Emperour

vſed a very ſtrange practiſe,A ſtrange practiſe to get money. that few Princes
would haue done in their greateſt extremities.
He reſigned his kingdome to one Velica
Knez Simeon, the Emperours ſonne of Gazan:
as though hee meant to draw himſelfe
from al publike doings to aquiet priuat life.
Towards the end of the yeere, hee cauſed
this newe King to call in all Charters graunted
to Biſhoprickes and Monaſteries, which
they had enioyed manie hundred yeeres
before. Which were all cancelled. This
done (as in diſlike of the fact and of the
miſgouernment of the newe King) hee reſumed
his ſcepter, and ſo was content as in
fauour to the Church and religious men)
that they ſhould renew their charters, &amp; take
them of himſelfe: reſeruing and annexing to
the Crowne ſo much of their lands, as himſelfe
thought good.
               By this practiſe hee wrung from the Biſhoprickes,
and Monaſteries (beſides the
landes which he annexed to the Crowne) an
huge maſſe of money. From ſome 40, from
ſome 50, from ſome an hundred thouſande
rubbels. And this aſwell for the increaſe
of his treaſurie, as to abate the ill opinion
of his harde gouernment, by a ſhewe of
woorſe in an other man. Wherein his
ſtrange ſpirite is to bee noted: that beyng
hated of his ſubiectes, (as himſelfe knew wel

inough) yet would venture ſuch a practiſe, to
ſet an other in his ſaddle, that might haue
ridde away with his horſe, while himſelfe
walked by on foote.
            
            
               5
               TO ſende their meſſengers into the Prouinces,
or ſhires where the ſpecial commodities
of their countrey grow, as furres,
waxe, hony, &amp;c. There to foreſtall &amp; ingroſſe
ſomtime one whole commodity, ſometime
two, or more, taking thē at ſmal prices what
thēſelues liſt, &amp; ſelling them againe at an exceſſiue
rate to their own marchants, and to
marchants ſtrangers. If they refuſe to buy
them, then to force them vnto it.
               The like is done when any commoditie
eyther natiue or forreine (as cloth of golde,
broade cloth, &amp;c▪) thus engroſſed by the Emperour,
and receiued into his treaſurie, happeneth
to decay, or marre by long lying, or
ſome other caſualtie. Which is forced vpon
the Marchants to be bought by them at the
Emperours price, whether they will or no.
This laſt yeere of 1589. was engroſſed all
the waxe of the countrey: ſo that none might
deale with that commoditie, but the Emperour
onely.
            
            
               6
               TO take vp &amp; engroſſe in like ſort ſometime
forreine commodities (as ſilkes,

cloth, ledde, pearle, &amp;c. brought into his
realm by Turkish marchants, Armenians, Bougharians,
Poles, Engliſh, and other. And then
to force his marchants to buy them of his officers
at his owne price.
            
            
               7
               TO make a Monopoly for the time of ſuch
cōmodities as are paid him for rēt, or cuſtom,
&amp; to inhanſe the price of thē, as furres,
corn, wood, &amp;c. What time none muſt ſell of
the ſame kind of cōmodity, til the Emperors
be all ſold. By this means hee maketh of his
rent, corn, &amp; other prouiſiō of victual (as before
was ſaid) about 200000. rubb. or marks
a yeere. Of his rent wood, hay, &amp;c. 30000.
rubbels, or thereabouts.
            
            
               8
               IN euery great towne of his Realme he hath
a Caback or drinking houſe, where is ſold aquavitae
(which they cal Ruſſe wine) mead, beere,
&amp;c. Out of theſe hee receiueth rent that amounteth
to a great ſumme of money. Some
yeeld 800, ſome 900, ſome a 1000 ſome 2000
or 3000. rubbels a yere. Wherein beſides the
baſe, and diſhonourable meanes to encreaſe
his treaſurie, many foule faultes are committed.
The poore labouring man, and
artificer, manie times ſpendeth all from his
wife, and children. Some vſe to lay in twentie,
thirtie, fourtie rubbels, or more into the

                  Caback, and vowe themſelues to the pot, till
all that be ſpent. And this (as he will ſay) for
the honour of Hoſpodare, or the Emperour.
You ſhall haue manie there that haue drunk
all away to the verie skinne, and ſo walk naked
(whom they call Naga.) While they are
in the Caback, none may call them foorth
whatſoeuer cauſe there be, becauſe he hindereth
the Emperours reuenue.
            
            
               9
               TO cauſe ſome of his Boiarens, or Nobles
of his court, (whom he vſeth vpon truſt)
that haue houſes in the Mosko, to faine them
ſelues robbed. Then to ſend for the Zemsk
                        ••
                     
                  
men, or Aldermen of the citie, and to commaund
them to finde out the robberie. In
default of not finding it, to praue or ſeaſſe
the citie for their miſgouernment in 8000.
9000. or 10000. rubbels at a time. This is
many times practiſed.
            
            
               10
               IN theſe exactions to ſhew their ſoueraigntie,
ſometime they vſe very plaine, and yet
ſtrange cauillations. As was that of Iuan Vaſilowich,
father to this Emperour, after this
ſort. He ſent into Permia fot certaine loads
of Cedar wood, whereof hee knew that none
grew in that Countrey. The inhabitants returned
anſwere they could find none there.
Whereupon hee ſeaſſed their Countrey in

12000. rubbels, as if they cōcealed the commoditie
of purpoſe. Againe he ſent to the
citie of Mosko to prouide for him a Colpack,
or meaſure full of liue fleas for a medicine.
They returned anſwere that the thing was
impoſsible. And if they could get them, yet
they could not meaſure them, for leaping
out. Whereupon he praued, or beat out of
their ſhinnes 7000. rubbels for amulct.
               By like cauillation hee extorted from his
Nobilitie 30000. rubbels, becauſe he miſſed
of his game, when he went a hunting for the
Hare: as if their hunting and murdering of
hares had bin the cauſe of it. Which the Nobilitie
(as the manner is) praued preſently
againe vpon the Mouſicks, or common people
of the Countrie. This may ſeeme a
ſtraunge kinde of extortion, by ſuch pleaſant
cauils to flieſe his poore ſubiectes in
good ſadneſſe: but that it agreeth with the
qualitie of thoſe Emperours, and the miſerable
ſubiection of that poore Countrie.
Theſe, and ſuch like meanes are practiſed
by the Emperours of Ruſſia,
to encreaſe their Treaſurie.
               
            
         
         
            
            Of the ſtate of the Communaltie, or
vulgar ſorte of people in the countrie
of Ruſſia.
            The 13. Chapter.
            
               THE condition of the commons,
and vulgar ſort of people
may partly be vnderſtood
by that which already hath
bin ſaid concerning the mā
               ner
of their gouernment, &amp;
the ſtate of the Nobilitie, with the ordering
of their Prouinces, and chiefe townes of the
land.The ſeruile and miſerable eſtate of the Ruſſe people. And firſt touching their libertie how
it ſtandeth with them, it may appeare by
this: that they are reckoned in no degree at
all, nor haue any ſuffrage nor place in their
Zabore, or high court of Parliament, where
their lawes and publique orders are concluded
vpon. Which commonly tend to the oppreſsion
of the commons. For the other two
degrees vz: of the Nobilitie, and Cleargie,
whiche haue a vote in the Parliaments
(though farre from that libertie that ought
to bee in common conſultations for the publique
benefite, according to the meaſure
and proportion of their degrees) are well
contented that the whole burden ſhall light
vpon the commons, ſo they may eaſe their

owne ſhoulders by laying all vpon them. Againe
into what ſeruile condition their libertie
is brought, not onely to the Prince, but to
the Nobles, and Gentlemen of the Countrie
(who themſelues alſo are but ſeruile, ſpecially
of late yeares) it may farther appeare by
their owne acknowledgments in their ſupplications,
and other writings to any of the
Nobles or chiefe officers of the Emperours.
Wherein they name and ſubſcribe themſelues
Kolophey, that is, their villaines, or
bondſlaues: as they of the Nobilitie doo vnto
the Emperour. This may truely be ſaide
of them, that there is no ſeruant nor bondſlaue
more awed by his Maiſter, nor kept
downe in a more ſeruile ſubiection, then the
poore people are, &amp; that vniuerſally, not only
by the Emperour, but by his Nobilitie, chief
officers, and ſouldiers. So that when a poore
Mouſick meeteth with any of them vpon the
high way, he muſt turne himſelfe about, as
not daring to looke him on the face, and fall
down with knocking of his head to the very
ground, as he doth vnto his Idoll.
            Secondly concerning the landes, goods,
and other poſſeſsions of the commons they
anſwere the name and lie common indeed
without any fenſe againſt the rapine, and
ſpoile, not onely of the higheſt, but of his
Nobilitie, officers, and ſouldiers. Beſides

the taxes, cuſtomes, ſeazures, and other publique
exactions done vpon them by the
Emperour, they are ſo racked and pulled by
the Nobles, officers, and meſſengers ſent abroad
by the Emperour in his publique affaires,
ſpecially in the Yammes (as they call
them) and thorough faire townes, that you
ſhall haue many villages and townes of halfe
a mile, and a mile long, ſtande all vnhabited
the people being fled all into other places
by reaſon of the extreame vſage and exactions
done vpon them. So that in the way towards
Mosko, betwixt Vologda and Yaruſlaueley
(which is two nineties after their reckoning,
litle more then an hundreth miles Engliſh)
there are in ſigt fiftie Darieunes or villages
at the leaſt, ſome halfe a mile, ſome a
mile long (that ſtand vacant) &amp; deſolate with
out any inhabitant. The like is in all other
places of the realme (as is ſaid by thoſe that
haue better trauelled the countrie then my
ſelfe had time, or occaſion to doo.
            The great oppreſsion ouer the poore
Commons, maketh thē to haue no courage
in following their trades: for that the more
they haue, the more daunger they are in, not
onely of their goods, but of their liues alſo.
And if they haue any thing, they conceale it
all they can, ſomtimes conueying it into Monaſteries,
ſometimes hiding it vnder the

ground, and in woods, as men are woont to
doo where they are in feare of forreine inuaſion.
In ſo much that many times you ſhall
ſee them afraid to be knowen to any Boiuren
or Gentleman of ſuch commodities as they
haue to ſell. I haue ſeene them ſometimes
when they haue ſayed open their commodities
for a liking (as their principall furres &amp;
ſuch like) to looke ſtill behind them, and towards
euery doore: as men in ſome feare, that
looked to be ſet vpon, &amp; ſurpriſed by ſome
enimie. Whereof asking the cauſe, I found it
to be this that they haue doubted leaſt ſome
Noblemā or Sinaboiarskey of the Emperour
had bene in cōpanie, &amp; ſo layed a traine for
thē to pray vpon their cōmodities perforce.
            This maketh the people (though otherwiſe
hardened to beare any toile) to giue
themſelues much to idlenes and drinking▪
as paſsing for no more, then from hand to
mouth. And hereof it commeth that the cō
               modities
of Ruſſia (as was ſaid before) as wax,
tallow, hydes, flaxe, hempe, &amp;c.) grow and goe
abroad in farre leſſe plentie then they were
woont to doo: becauſe the people being oppreſſed
and ſpoiled of their gettings, are diſcouraged
from their laboures. Yet this one
thing is much to be noted, that in all this oppreſsion
there were three brethren Marchants
of late that traded together with one

ſtocke in common, that were found to bee
woorth 300000. rubbels in money, beſides
landes, cattels, and other commodities.
Which may partly be imputed to their dwellings
far of from the eye of the Court, vz. in
Wichida, a 1000. miles from Mosko, &amp; more.
The ſame are ſaid by thoſe that knew them
to haue ſet on worke all the yeare long ten
thouſand men in making of ſalt, carriages by
cart, &amp; boat, hewing of wood, and ſuch like:
beſides 5000 bondſlaues at the leaſt, to inhabite
and till their land.
            They had alſo their phyſitions, ſurgeons,
apothecaries, and all manner of artificers of
Doutches and others, belonging vnto them.
They are ſaid to haue paied to the Emperour
for cuſtome to the ſum of 23000. rubbles a
yeare (for which cauſe they were ſuffered to
enioy their trade) beſides the mainteining
of certeine garriſons on the borders of Siberia,
which were neare vnto thē. Wherin the
Emperour was content to vſe their purſe, till
ſuch time as they had got ground in Siberia,
and made it habitable, by burning, and cutting
downe woods from Wichida to Perm,
aboue a 1000. verſe and then tooke it all away
from them perforce.
            But this in the end beyng enuied, and
diſdained, as a matter not ſtanding with
their pollicie to haue any ſo great, ſpecially

a Mouſick, the Emperour began firſt to
to pull frō them by pieces, ſometimes 20000
rubbels at a time, ſometime more: till in the
end their ſonnes that now are, are well eaſed
of their ſtocke, and haue but ſmall parte
of their fathers ſubſtance: the reſt being
drawen all into the Emperours treaſurie.
Their names were Iacoue, Gregorie, &amp; Simon
the ſonnes of Onyka.
            
            For the qualitie of their people otherwiſe,The tyranny and oppreſsion ouer their very minds and wits.
though there ſeemeth to be in them
ſome aptneſſe to receyue any art (as appeareth
by the naturall wittes in the men, and
very children) yet they excell in no kinde of
common arte, much leſſe in any learning,
or litterall kinde of knowledge: which they
are kept from of purpoſe, as they are alſo
from all militarie practiſe: that they may be
fitter for the ſeruile condition, wherein now
they are, and haue neyther reaſon, nor valure
to attempt innouation. For this purpoſe
alſo they are kept from traueling, that
they may learne nothing, nor ſee the faſhions
of other Countries abroad. You
ſhall ſeldome ſee a Ruſſe a traueller, except
he be with ſome Ambaſſadour, or that
he make a ſcape out of his Countrie. Which
hardly he can doo, by reaſon of the borders
that are watched ſo narrowly, and the puniſhment
for any ſuch attempt, which is

death if he be taken, and all his goods confiſcate.
Onely they learne to write, and to
read, and that very few of them. Neither doo
they ſuffer any ſtraunger willingly to come
into their realme out of any ciuill Countrie,
for the ſame cauſe, farther then neceſsitie of
vttering their commodities, and taking in of
forreine doth enforce them to doo.
            And therefore this yeare 1589. they conſulted
about the remouing of all Marchants
ſtraungers to the border townes,The ielouſie of the Emperour concerning his ſtate. to abide
and haue their reſidencie there, and to bee
more wary in admitting other ſtraungers
hereafter into the Inland parts of the realm,
for feare of infection with better manners
and qualities, then they haue of their owne.
For the ſame purpoſe alſo they are kept
within the boundes of their degree by the
lawes of their countrie: ſo that the ſonne of
a Mouſick, artificer, or husbandman, is euer
a Mouſick artificer, &amp;c: and hath no means
to aſpire any higher: except hauing learned
to write and read, he attaine to the preferment
of a Prieſt, or Dyack. Their language is
all one with the Slauonian, which is thought
to haue bene deriued from the Ruſſe tongue,
rather then the Ruſſe from the Slauonian. For
the people called Sclaui, are knowen to haue
had their beginning out of Sarmatia, and to
haue termed themſelues of their conqueſt

               Sclauos, (that is) famous or glorious, of the
word Sclaua, which in the Ruſſe &amp; Slauonian
tongue, ſignifieth as much as Glory, or Fame.
Though afterwards being ſubdued and trod
vpon by diuers nations, the Italians their
neighbours haue turned the worde to a contrary
ſignification, and terme euery ſeruant
or peaſant by the name of Sclaue, as did the
Romanes by the Getes &amp; Syrians, for the ſame
reaſon. The Ruſſe character or letter is no
other then the Greeke, ſomewhat diſtorted.
            Concerning their trades, diet, apparell,
and ſuch like, it is to be noted in a ſeuerall
chapter of their priuate behauiour. This order
that bindeth euery man to keepe his
rancke, and ſeuerall degree, wherin his forefathers
liued before him, is more meet to
keepe the ſubiects in a ſeruile ſubiection▪ and
ſo apt for this and like Common-wealths,
then to aduaunce any vertue, or to breed any
rare or excellent qualitie in Nobilitie or
Commons: as hauing no farther rewarde
nor preferment, whereunto they may bend
their endeuours, and imploy themſelues to
aduaunce their eſtate but rather procuring
more danger to themſelues,
the more they excell in any
noble or principall
qualitie.

or Bailief of the ſoake or hundred, wherof I
ſpake before in the ordering of the Prouinces.

Lords of the Chetfirds (as before was ſayd)
From theſe courts they may appeale,The high Court of Mosko.
                and remoue
their ſuites to the chiefe Court, that is
kept at the Mosko, where are reſident the officers
of the foure Chetfirds. Theſe are the
chiefe Iuſtices or Iudges, euery of them in all
ciuill matters that grow within their ſeuerall
Chetfird or quarter, and may be either commenced
originally before them, or proſequuted
out of the inferiour Courts of the Shires
by way of appeale.
            Their commencing,Their mā
                  ner of procedeing in Ciuill matters. and proceeding in
ciuill actions is on this manner. Firſt, the
plaintife putteth vp his ſupplication, wherein
hee declareth the effect of his cauſe, or
wrong done vnto him. Whereupon is granted
vnto him a Wepis, or warrant, which
hee deliuereth to the Praeſtaue, or Sergeant,
to doo the arreſt vpon the partie whom hee
meaneth to implead. Who vpon the arreſt,
is to put in ſureties to anſwere the day
appointed, or els ſtandeth at the Sergeants
deuotion, to be kept ſafe by ſuch meanes as
he thinketh good.
            The Sergeants are many, and excell for
their hard and cruell dealing towards their
pryſoners, commonly they clappe irons
vpon them, as many as they can beare, to
wring out of them ſome larger fees. Though
it bee but for ſixe pence, you ſhall ſee them

goe with chaynes on their legges, armes,
and necke. When they come before the
Iudge, the plaintife beginneth to declare
his matter after the content of his ſupplication.
As for Attourneis Counſellours, Procuratours
&amp; Aduocates to plead their cauſe
for them, they haue no ſuch order, but euery
man is to tell his owne tale, and plead for
himſelfe, ſo well as he can.
            If they haue any witneſſe, or other euidence,Ending of controuerſies by kiſſing the Croſſe.
they produce it before the Iudge. If
they haue none, or if the truth of the cauſe
cannot ſo well bee decerned by the plea, or
euidence on both partes: then the Iudge
asketh eyther partie (which hee thinketh
good plaintife or defendant) whether hee
will kiſſe the Croſſe, vpon that which he auoucheth,
or denieth. Hee that taketh the
Croſſe (being ſo offered by the Iudge) is accounted
cleare, and carrieth away the matter.
This ceremonie is not done within the
Court or office, but the partie is carried to
the Church by an officer, and there the ceremonie
is done: the mony in the meane
while hanging vpon a naile, or els lying at
the idols feete, ready to be deliuered to the
partie, as ſoone as he hath kiſſed the Croſſe
before the ſaid Idoll.
            This kiſsing of the Croſſe (called Creuſtina
chelouania) is as their corporall oath.

and accounted with them a very holy thing,Iudgement by lotte.
which no man will dare to violate, or prophane
with a falſe allegation. If both parties
offer to kiſſe the Croſſe in a contradictorie
matter, then they drawe lottes. The
better lotte is ſuppoſed to haue the right,
and beareth away the matter. So the partie
conuicted is adiudged to pay the debt or
penaltie whatſoeuer, and withall to pay the
Emperours fees, which is twentie pence
vpon euery marke, as before hath bene noted.
            When the matter is thus ended, the partie
conuicted is deliuered to the Sergeant,
who hath a writte for his warrant out of the
office, to carry him to the Praueuſh or Righter
of Iuſtice, if preſently hee pay not the
monie, or content not the partie. This
Praueuſh or Righter, is a place neare to the
office: where ſuch as haue ſentence paſſed
againſt them, and refuſe to pay that which
is adiudged, are beaten with great cudgels
on the ſhinnes, and calues of their legges.
Euery forenoone from eight to eleuen, they
are ſet on the Praueuſh, and beate in this
ſort till the monie be payd. The afternoone
and night time, they are kepte in chaines by
the Sergeant: except they put in ſufficient
ſuerties for their apparance at the Praueuſh
at the hower appointed. You ſhall ſee fortie

or fiftie ſtand together on the Praueuſh
all on a rowe, and their ſhinnes thus becudgelled,
and bebaſted euery morning with
a piteous crie. If after a yeares ſtanding on
the Praueuſh, the partie will not, or lacke
wherewithall to ſatisfie his creditour, it is
lawfull for him to fell his wife, and children,
eyther out right, or for a certaine terme of
yeares. And if the price of them doo not amount
to the full payment, the creditour
may take them to bee his bondſlaues, for
yeares or for euer, according as the value of
the debt requireth.
            Such kinde of ſuites as lacke direct euidence,
or ſtande vpon coniectures and circumſtances
to bee waighed by the Iudge,
drawe of great length, and yeeld great aduantage
to the Iudge▪ and officers. If the
ſuite be vpon a bond, or bill, they haue for
the moſte parte good and ſpeedy iuſtice.
Their bonds, or billes are drawen in a very plaine
ſorte,The forme of Ruſſe bils or bonds. after this tenour. I Iuan Vaſileo
haue borrowed of Alphonaſſe Dementio,
the ſumme of one hundred rubbles of going money
of Mosko. from the Kreſhenea (or hallowing
of the water) vntill the Saburney voſcreſhenea
(or Counſell Sunday) without intereſt.
And if this money reſt vnpayed after that
day, then hee ſhall giue intereſt vpon the ſayd
money, after the common rate, as it goeth among

the people, vz. for euerie fiue the ſixt rubbell.
Vpon this there are witneſſes, Micheta Sydroueskoy,
&amp;c: Subſcribed. This bill haue I written
Gabriell I acoueleſni, in the yeare 7096. The
witneſſes, and debter (if he can write) endorſe
their names on the backe ſide of the
bill. Other ſigning, or ſealing haue they
none.
            When any is taken for a matter of crime
(as treaſon,Proceeding in criminall matters. murder, thefte, and ſuch like)
hee is firſt brought to the Duke, and Diack,
that are for the Prouince where the partie
is attached, by whom hee is examined. The
manner of examination in ſuch caſes, is all
by torture, as ſcourging with whips made
of ſinowes, or whitleather (called the Pudkey)
as bigge as a mans finger, which giueth
a ſore laſh, and entreth into the fleſh,
or by tying to a ſpit and roſting at the fire,
ſometimes by breaking and wreſting one
of their ribbes with a pavre of hote tongues,
or cutting their fleſh vnder the nayles, and
ſuch like.
            The examination thus taken withall the
proofes, and euidences that can bee alleadged
againſt the partie, it is ſent vp to the
Mosko to the Lord of the Chetfird or Fourthparte,
vnder whom the Prouince is, and by
him is preſented to the Counſell table, to
bee read and ſentenced there, where onely

iudgement is giuen in matter of life &amp; death,
and that by euidence vpon information,
though they neuer ſawe nor heard the partie,
who is kept ſtill in pryſon where the fact
was committed, and neuer ſent vp to the
place where he is tried. If they find the partie
guiltie, they giue ſentence of death according
to the qualitie of the fact: which is ſent
downe by the Lord of the Chetfird, to the
Duke and Diack to bee put in execution.
The priſoner is carried to the place of execution
with his handes bounde, and a waxe
candle burning helde betwixt his fingers▪
            
            Their capitall puniſhmentes are hanging,
hedding, knocking on the head, drowning,
putting vnder the yſe, ſetting on a
ſtake, and ſuch like. But for the moſt part
the priſoners that are condemned in Sommer,
are kept for the winter, to be knockt
in the head, and put vnder the yſe. This is
to bee vnderſtood of common perſons. For
theft, and murder, if they be committed vpon
a poore Mouſick by one of Nobilitie
are not lightly puniſhed, nor yet is hee called
to any account for it. Their reaſon is,
becauſe they are accounted their Kolophey,
or bondſlaues. If by ſome Sinaboiarskey,
or Gentleman ſouldier, a murder or theft
bee committed, peraduenture he ſhal be impriſoned
at the Emperours pleaſure. If the

manner of the fact be verie notorious, he is
whipped perchance, and this is commonly
all the puniſhment that is inflicted vpon
them.
            If a man kill his owne ſeruant little, or nothing
is ſaid vnto him, for the ſame reaſon:
becauſe hee is accounted to be his Kolophey,
or bondſlaue, and ſo to haue right ouer his
verie head. The moſt is ſome ſmall mulct to
the Emperour, if the partie be rich: &amp; ſo the
quarell is made rather againſt the purſe, then
againſt the iniuſtice. They haue no written
law, ſaue onely a ſmal booke that conteineth
the time, and manner of their ſitting, order
in proceeding▪ and ſuch other iudicial forms
and circumſtances, but nothing to direct thē
to giue ſentence vpon right or wrong. Their
onely lawe is their Speaking Law, that is, the
pleaſure of the Prince, and of his Magiſtrates
and officers. Which ſheweth the miſerable
condition of this poore people, that are forced
to haue them for their law, and direction
of iuſtice, againſt whoſe iniuſtice, and extreame
oppreſsion, they had neede
to be armed with many good,
and ſtrong lawes.
         
         
            
            Their forces for the warres, with the chief
officers and their ſalaries.
            The 15. Chapter.
            
               THe ſouldiers of Ruſſia are called
Sinaboiarskey, or the ſons
of Gentlemen: becauſe they
are all of that degree, by vertue
of their millitary profeſsion.
For euery ſouldier in Ruſſia
is a gentleman, and none are gentlemen,
but only the ſouldiers, that take it by diſcent
from their anceſtors: ſo that the ſonne of a
gentleman (which is borne a ſouldier) is euer
a gentlemā,Souldiers by birth &amp; inheritāce. &amp; a ſouldier withal▪ &amp; profeſſeth
nothing els but militarie matters. Whē they
are of yeeres able to beare armes, they come
to the office of Roſerade, or great Conſtable,
and there preſent themſelues: who entreth
their names, and allotteth them certeine
lands to maintein their charges, for the
moſt part the ſame that their fathers enioyed
For the lands aſsigned to mainteine the
army, are euer certein, annexed to this office
without improuing, or detracting one foot.
But that if the Emperour haue ſufficient in
wages, the roomes being full ſo farre as the
lande doeth extend already, they are manie

times deferred, and haue nothing allowed
them, except ſome one portiō of the land be
deuided into two. Which is a cauſe of great
diſorder within that countrie: when a ſouldier
that hath many children, ſhal haue ſometimes
but one intertained in the Emperours
pay. So that the reſt hauing nothing, are forced
to liue by vniuſt and wicked ſhiftes, that
tend to the hurt &amp; oppreſsion of the Mouſick,
or common ſort of people. This inconuenience
groweth by mainteining his forces
in a continual ſucceſsion. The whole number
of his ſouldiers in continual pay, is this.
Firſt, he hath of his Dworaney, that is, Penſioners,
or Gard of his perſon, to the number of
15000. horſemen, with their captaines, and
other officers, that are alwaies in a readines.
            Of theſe 15000. horſemen,Degrees of horſemen. there are three
ſorts or degrees, which differ aſwell in eſtimation,
as in wages, one degree from another.1. Praetoriaenior ſuch as attend the Emperours perſon, 15000.
The firſt ſort of them is, called Dworaney
Bulſhey, or the company of head Penſioners,
that haue, ſome an hundred, ſome fourſcore
rubbels a yeere, and none vnder 70.
The ſecond ſort are called Seredney Dworaney,
or the middle ranke of Penſioners. Theſe
haue ſixty, or fiftie rubbels by the yere, none
vnder fourtie. The third and loweſt ſort are
the Dyta Boiarskey, that is, the lowe Penſioners.
Their ſalarie is thirty rubbels a yere for

him that hath moſt, ſome haue but fiue and
twentie, ſome twentie, none vnder twelue.
Whereof the halfe part is paid them at the
Mosko, the other halfe in the field by the generall,
when they haue anie warres, and are
imployed in ſeruice. When they receiue their
whole pay, it amounteth to 55000. rubbels
by the yeere.
            And this is their wages, beſides lands allotted
to euery one of them, both to the
greater and the leſſe, according to their degrees.
Whereof he that hath leaſt, hath to
yeeld him twentie rubbels, or marks by the
yeere. Beſides theſe 15000. horſemen▪ that
are of better choyce (as being the Emperors
own gard when himſelf goeth to the warres,
not vnlike the Romane ſouldiers called Praetoriani)
are a 110. men of ſpecial account for
their Nobilitie, and truſt, which are choſen
by the Emperour, and haue their names regiſtred,Two other troupes to the number of 65000.
that find among them for the Emperours
warres, to the number of 65000. horſmen,
with all neceſſaries meet for the warres
after the Ruſſe manner.
            To this end they haue yeerely allowance
made by the Emperour for themſelues, and
their companies, to the ſumme of 40000.
rubbels. And theſe 65000 are to repaire to
the field euery yeere on the borders towards
the Chrim Tartar, (except they bee appoynted

for ſome other ſeruice) whether there be
warres with the Tartars, or not. This might
ſeeme peraduenture ſomwhat dangerous for
ſome ſtate, to haue ſo great forces vnder the
command of Noblemen to aſſemble euerie
yeere to one certeine place. But the matter is
ſo vſed, as that no danger can grow to the
Emperour, or his ſtate by this meanes. 1. Becauſe
theſe noblemen are manie, to wit, an
110. in all, and changed by the Emperor ſo
oft as he thinketh good. 2. Becauſe they haue
their liuings of the Emperour, being otherwiſe
but of very ſmall reuenue, and receiue
this yeerely pay of 40000. rubbels, when it
is preſently to be paide foorth againe to the
ſouldiers that are vnder them. 3. Becauſe for
the moſt part they are about the Emperours
perſon, being of his Councel either ſpeciall,
or at large. 4. They are rather as paymaſters,
then Captaines to their companies,
themſelues not going forth ordinarily to the
warres, ſaue when ſome of them are appointed
by ſpeciall order from the Emperour
himſelfe.Horſemen in cōtinuall pay 80000. So the whole number of horſemen
that are euer in a readineſſe, and in continuall
pay, are 80000, a few more or leſſe.
            If hee haue neede of a greater number
(which ſeldome falleth out) then he interteineth
of thoſe Sinaboiarskey, that are out of
pay, ſo many as hee needeth: and if yet hee

want of his number, he giueth charge to his
Noblemen, that hold lands of him, to bring
into the fielde euery man a proportionable
number of his ſeruaunts (called Kolophey,
ſuch as till his lands) with their furniture,
according to the iuſt number that he
intendeth to make. Which the ſeruice being
done, preſently lay in their weapons,
and returne to their ſeruile occupations againe.
            Of footmen that are in continuall pay,Footmen in continuall pay 12000. he
hath to the number of 12000. all Gunners,
called Strelſey. Whereof 5000. are to attend
about the Citie of Mosko, or any other
place where the Emperour ſhall abide, and
2000. (which are called Stremaney, Streſley, or
Gunners at the ſtirrop) about his owne
perſon at the verie Court or houſe where
himſelfe lodgeth. The reſt are placed in
his garriſon Townes, till there be occaſion
to haue them in the fielde, and receiue
for their ſalarie or ſtipend euery man ſeuen
rubbels a yeere, beſides twelue meaſures,
a piece of Rye, and Oates. Of mercenarie
Souldiers, that are ſtrangers (whom they
call Nimſchoy) they haue at this time 4300.Strangers mercenaries in pay 4300.
of Polonians: of Chirchaſſes (that are vnder
the Polonians) about 4. thouſand, whereof
3500. are abroad in his garriſons: of Doutches
and Scots about 150: of Greekes, Turks,

Danes and Sweadens, all in one band, an 100.
or thereabouts. But theſe they vſe onely vpon
the Tartar ſide, and againſt the Siberians:
as they doe the Tartar ſouldiers (whom
they hire ſometimes, but onely for the preſent)
on the other ſide againſt the Polonian
and Sweaden: thinking it beſt pollicie ſo
to vſe their ſeruice vpon the contrary border.
            The chiefe Captaines or leaders of theſe
forces,The chiefe captaines or leaders. according to their names, and degrees,1. The Voiauod or Generall.
are theſe which follow. Firſt the Voyauodey
Bulſhaia, that is, the Great Captaine, or
Lieftenant generall vnder the Emperour.
This commonly is one of the foure houſes
of the chiefe Nobilitie of the lande:
but ſo choſen otherwiſe, as that hee is
of ſmall valure, or practiſe in martiall matters,
beeyng thought to ſerue that turne
ſo much the better, if hee bring no other
partes with him ſaue the countenance of his
Nobilitie, to bee liked of by the ſouldiers
for that, and nothing els. For in this poynt
they are very warie that theſe two (to wit) nobilitie,
and power meet not both in one, ſpecially
if they ſee wiſedome with all, or aptneſſe
for pollicie.
            Their great Voiauod or Generall at this
preſent in their warres, is commonly one of
theſe foure: Knez Feodor Iuanowich Methiſſoskey

Knez Iuan Michailowich Glinskoy, Cherechaskoy,
and Trowbetskoy, all of great Nobilitie,
but of very ſimple qualitie otherwiſe:
though in Glinskoy (as they ſay) there is
ſomewhat more then in the reſt. To make
vp this defect in the Voiauod or Generall,2. Liefetenant generall.
there is ſome other ioyned with him as Lieftenant
Generall, of farre leſſe nobilitie, but of
more valure and experience in the warres
then he, who ordereth all things that the other
countenanceth. At this time their principall
man, and moſt vſed in their warres, is
one Knez Demetrie Iuanowich Foreſtine, an
auncient and expert captaine, and one that
hath done great ſeruice (as they ſay) againſt
the Tartar,
               3. Marſhals of the field foure. and Polonian. Next vnder the Voiauod
and his Lieftenant generall are foure other
that haue the marſhalling of the whole
army deuided among them, and may be called
the marſhals of the field.
            Euery man hath his quarter, or fourth
part vnder him. Whereof the firſt is called
the Praua Polskoy, or right wing. The ſecond
is the Leuoy Polskoy, or left wing. The third
is Ruſnoy Polskoy, or the broken bād▪ becauſe
out of this there are choſen to ſend abroade
vpon any ſodaine exploit, or to make a reſcue▪
               Foure marſhals deputies 8.

haue two other vnder them (eight in all) that
twiſe euery weeke at the leaſt muſt muſter
and traine their ſeueral wings or bands, and
hold and giue iuſtice for all faultes, and diſorders
committed in the campe.
            And theſe eight are commonly choſen
out of the 110. (which I ſpake of before) that
receiue and deliuer the pay to the ſouldiers.
Vnder theſe eight are diuers other Captains,Fiue Cotonels vnder Captaines.
as the Gul auoy, Captaines of thouſands fiue
hundreds and 100. The Petyde Setskoy or
Captaines of fifties, and the Decetskies or
Captaines of tennes.
            Beſides the Voiauoda or Generall of the
Armie (ſpoken of before) they haue two
other that beare the name of Voiauoda:
whereof one is the Maſter of the great Ordinance
(called Naradna voiauoda) who hath diuers
vnder Officers,Sixe Maſters of the Artillerie. neceſſarie for that ſeruice.
The other is called the Voiauoda gulauoy,
or the walking Captaine,The waking Captaine. that hath alowed
him 1000. good horſemen of principall
choyſe, to range and ſpie abroad, and
hath the charge of the running Caſtle, which
we are to ſpeake of in the Chapter folowing.
All theſe Captaines, and men of charge
muſt once euery day reſort to the Bulſha
voiauoda or Generall of the Armie, to know
his pleaſure, &amp; to informe him, if there be any
requiſite matter perteining to their office.
         
         
            
            Of their muſtering, and leuying of forces,
manner of armour, and
prouiſion of victuall for
the warres.
            The 16. Chapter.
            
               WHen warres are
towards (which
they fayle not
of lightly euery
yeere with the
Tartar, and manie
times with
the Polonian and
Sweden (the foure
Lordes of the
Chetfirds ſende foorth their ſummons in the
Emperours name,Their order for muſtering. to all the Dukes and Dyacks
of the Prouinces, to bee proclaymed
in the head Townes of euery Shire: that all
the Sinaboiarskey, or ſonnes of gentlemen
make their repaire to ſuch a border where
the ſeruice is to be done, at ſuch a place,
and by ſuch a day, and there preſent them
ſelues to ſuch, and ſuch Captaines. When
they come to the place aſsigned them in

the ſummons or proclamation, their names
are taken by certaine Officers that haue
Cōmiſsion for that pourpoſe from the Roſerade,
or high Conſtable, as Clarkes of the
Bandes.
            If any make default and faile at the day,
hee is mulcted, and puniſhed very ſeuerely.
As for the Generall and other chiefe Captaines,
they are ſent thither from the Emperours
owne hande, with ſuch Commiſsion
and charge as hee thinketh behoofull
for the preſent ſeruice. When the ſouldiers
are aſſembled, they are reduced into
their Bands, and companies, vnder their ſeuerall
Captaines of tennes, fifties, hundreds,
thouſands, &amp;c. and theſe Bands into foure
Polskeis, or Legions (but of farre greater
numbers then the Romaine Legions were)
vnder their foure great Leaders, which alſo
haue the authoritie of Marſhals of the fielde
(as was ſayd before.)
            Concerning their armour they are but
ſlightly appointed.The horſemans furniture. The common horſeman
hath nothing els but his bow in his caſe vnder
his right arme, and his quiuer &amp; ſword
hanging on the left ſide: except ſome fewe
that beare a caſe of dagges, or a Iauelin, or
ſhort ſtaffe along their horſe ſide. The vnder
captains wil haue cōmonly ſome piece of armour
beſides, as a ſhirt of male, or ſuch like.

The Generall with the other chiefe Captaines
and men of Nobilitie, will haue their
horſe very richly furniſhed, their Saddles of
cloth of golde their Bridles faire boſſed and
taſſelled with golde, and ſilke frindge, beſtudded
with Pearle and precious ſtones,
themſelues in very faire armour, which they
call Bullatnoy, made of faire ſhining ſteele,
yet couered commonly with cloth of golde,
and edged rounde with armin furre, his
ſteele helmet on his head of a very great
price, his ſword bow and arrowes at his ſide,
his ſpeare in his hande, with an other faire
helmet, and his Sheſtapera, or horſemans
ſcepter carried before him. Their ſwordes,
bowes, and arrowes are of the Turkiſh faſhion.
They practiſe like the Tartar to ſhoote
forwards and backwards, as they flie and
retire.
            The Strelſey or footeman hath nothing
but his piece in his hande,The footemans furniture. his ſtriking hatchet
at his backe, and his ſworde by his ſide.
The ſtocke of his piece is not made calieuer
wiſe, but with a plaine and ſtraite ſtocke
(ſomewhat like a fowling piece) the barrel
is rudely and vnartificially made, very heauie,
yet ſhooteth but a very ſmall bullet. As
for their prouiſion of victuall,Prouiſion of victuall. the Emperour
alloweth none, either for Captaine,
or ſouldiour, neither prouideth any for

them except peraduenture ſome corne for
their money. Euery man is to bring ſufficient
for him ſelfe, to ſerue his turne for
foure moneths, and if neede require to
giue order for more to bee brought vnto
him to the Campe from his tenant that
tilleth his land, or ſome other place. One
great helpe they haue, that for lodging and
diet euery Ruſſe is prepared to bee a ſouldiour
beforehand. Though the chiefe Captaines
and other of account carry tents with
them after the faſhion of ours, with ſome
better prouiſion of victuall then the reſt.
They bring with them commonly into the
Campe for victuall a kinde of dryed bread,
(which they call Sucharie) with ſome ſtore
of meale, which they temper with water,
and ſo make it into a ball, or ſmall lumpe of
dowe, called Tollockno. And this they eate raw
in ſteade of bread. Their meate is bacon, or
ſome other fleſh or fiſh dryed, after the
Dutch manner. If the Ruſſe ſouldier were as
hardy to execute an enterpriſe, as he is hard
to beare out toyle and trauaile, or were otherwiſe
as apt &amp; wel trained for the warres,
as he is indifferent for his lodging and dyet,
hee would farre exceede the ſouldiours
of our partes. Whereas now he is farre meaner
of courage and execution in any warlike
ſeruice. Which commeth partly of his

ſeruile condition, that will not ſuffer any
great courage or valure to growe in him.
Partly for lacke of due honour and reward,
which he hath no great hope of, whatſoeuer
ſeruice or execution he doe.
         
         
            Of their marching, charging, and other
Martiall diſcipline.
            The 17. Chapter.
            
               THE Ruſſe truſteth
rather to
his number, thē
to the valure of
his ſouldiers, or
good ordering
of his forces.
Their marching
or leading is
without all order,
ſaue that the foure Polskey or Legions,
(whereinto their armie is deuided) keepe
themſelues ſeueral vnder their enſignes, and
ſo thruſt all on together in a hurrey, as they
are directed by their Generall. Their Enſigne
is the image of Saint George. The Bulſha
Dworaney or chiefe horſemen, haue euery
man a ſmall drumme of braſſe at his ſaddle
bowe,Horſemens drummes. which hee ſtriketh when hee giueth

the charge, or onſet.
            They haue drummes beſides of a huge
bigneſſe,The horſemans manner of charging. which they carry with them vpon
a board layde on foure horſes, that are ſparred
together with chaines, euery drumme
hauing eight ſtrikers, or drummers, beſides
trumpets and ſhawmes, which they ſounde
after a wilde manner, much different from
ours. When they giue any charge, or make
any inuaſion, they make a great hallowe or
ſhoute altogether as loude as they can, which
with the ſound of their trumpets, ſhawmes,
and drummes, maketh a confuſed and horrible
noyſe. So they ſet on firſt diſcharging
their arrowes, then dealing with their
ſwordes, which they vſe in a brauerie to
ſhake, and brandiſh ouer their heads, before
they come to ſtrokes.
            Their footemen (becauſe otherwiſe they
want order in leading) are commonly placed
in ſome ambuſh or place of aduantage,The footemans charge.
where they may moſt annoy the enemie,
with leaſt hurt to themſelues. If it bee a ſet
battell, or if any great inuaſion be made vpon
the Ruſſe borders by the Tartar, they are
ſet within the running or mouing Caſtle (called
Beza,
               The walking Caſtle or Gulay gorod) which is caried about
with them by the Voiauoda gulauoy (or
the walking General) whom I ſpake of before.
This walking or moouing Caſtle is ſo framed,

that it may bee ſet vp in length (as
occaſion doeth require) the ſpace of one,
two, three, foure, fiue, ſixe, or ſeuen miles:
for ſo long it will reach. It is nothing els but
a double wall of wood to defende them on
both ſides behinde and before, with a ſpace
of three yardes or thereabouts betwixt the
two ſides: ſo that they may ſtande within it,
and haue roome ynough to charge and diſcharge
their pieces, and to vſe their other
weapons. It is cloſed at both endes, and
made with loope holes on either ſide, to
lay out the noſe of their piece, or to puſh
foorth any other weapon. It is carried with
the Armie whereſoeuer it goeth, being taken
into pieces, and ſo layed on cartes ſparred
together, and drawen by horſe that are
not ſeene, by reaſon that they are couered
with their carriage as with a ſhelfe or penthouſe.
When it is brought to the place where
it is to be vſed (which is deuiſed &amp; choſen out
before by the walking voiauod) it is planted
ſo much as the preſent vſe requireth, ſometime
a mile long, ſometimes two, ſometimes
three, or more: Which is ſoone done without
the helpe of any Carpenter, or inſtrument:
becauſe the timber is ſo framed to claſpe
together one piece within an other: as is eaſily
vnderſtood by thoſe that know the maner
of the Ruſſe building.
            
               
In this Caſtle ſtandeth their ſhotte well
fenced for aduantage, ſpecially againſt the
Tartar, that bringeth no ordinance, nor other
weapon into the field with him, ſaue his
ſwoord, and bow and arrowes. They haue
alſo within it diuers field pieces, which they
vſe as occaſion doth require. Of pieces for
the field they carry no great ſtore, when they
warre againſt the Tartar: but when they
deale with the Polonian (of whoſe forces they
make more account) they goe better furniſhed
with al kind of munition, and other neceſſarie
prouiſions. It is thought that no
Prince of Chriſtendome hath better ſtoare
of munition, then the Ruſſe Emperour. And
it may partly appeare by the Artillerie houſe
at Mosko, where are of all ſortes of great
ordinance, all braſſe pieces, very faire, to an
exceeding great number.
            The Ruſſe ſouldier is thought to be better
at his defence within ſome caſtle, or town,
then hee is abroad at a ſet pitched field.
Which is euer noted in the practiſe of his
warres, and namely at the ſiege of Vobsko, about
eight yeares ſince: where hee repulſed
the Polonian king Stepan Batore, with his
whole armie of 100000. men, and forced
him in the ende to giue ouer his ſiege, with
the loſſe of many of his beſt Captaines and
ſouldiers. But in a ſet field the Ruſſe is noted

to haue euer the worſe of the Polonian, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Sweden.
            
            If any behaue himſelfe more valiantly
then the reſt, or doo any ſpeciall piece of
ſeruice, the Emperour ſendeth him a piece
of golde, ſtamped with the Image of Saint
George on horſebacke.Reward for valure. Which they hang
on their ſleeues, and ſet in their caps. And
this is accounted the greateſt honour they
can receiue, for any ſeruice they doo.
         
         
            Of their Colonies, and mainteyning
of their conqueſts, or purchaſes
by force.
            The 18. Chapter.
            
               THE Ruſſe Emperours
of late yeres
haue verie muche
enlarged their dominions,
and territories.
Their firſt
conqueſt after the
Dukedom of Mosko
(for before that
time they were but
Dukes of Volodomer, as before was ſayd)

was the Citie, and Dukedome of Nouograd
on the Weſt, and Northweſt ſide: which was
no ſmall enlargement of their dominion, &amp;
ſtrengthning to them for the winning of the
reſt. This was done by Iuan great grandfather
to Theodore now Emperour, about the
yeare 1480. The ſame began likewiſe to encroach
vpon the countries of Lituania, and
Liuonia, but the conqueſt onely intended, &amp;
attempted by him vpon ſome parte of thoſe
countries, was purſued and performed by his
ſonne Baſileus, who firſt wan the citie and
dukedome of Plesko, afterwards the citie &amp;
dukedome of Smolensko, &amp; many other faire
towns, with a large territorie belonging vnto
thē about the yeare 1514. Theſe victories
againſt the Lettoes or Lituanians in the time
of Alexander their Duke, he atchiued rather
by aduantage of ciuill diſſentions, and treaſons
among themſelues, then by any great
policie, or force of his owne. But all this was
loſt againe by his ſonne Iuan Vaſilowich, about
eight or nine yeares paſt, vpon compoſitiō
with the Polonian king Stepan Batore:
whereunto hee was forced by the aduantages
which the Pole had then of him, by reaſon
of the foile he had giuen him before, and
the diſquietnes of his owne ſtate at home.
Onely the Ruſſe Emperour, at this time hath
left him on that ſide his countrie, the cities of

               Smolensko, Vitobsko, Cheringo and Beala gorod
in Lituania. In Liuonia, not a towne, nor one
foote of ground.
            When Baſileus firſt conquered thoſe countries,Lituania.
he ſuffered the natiues to keepe their
poſſeſsions, and to inhabite all their townes,
onely paying him a tribute, vnder the gouernment
of his Ruſſe Captaines. But by their
conſpiracies and attempts not long after, he
was taught to deale more ſurely with them.
And ſo comming vpon them the ſecond
time, hee killed and carried away with him,
three partes of foure, which hee gaue or
ſolde to the Tartars that ſerued him in
thoſe warres, and in ſteede of them placed
there his Ruſſes, ſo many as might ouermatch
the reſt, with certaine garriſons of
ſtrength beſides. Wherein notwithſtanding
this ouerſight was committed, for that (taking
away with him the vpland, or countrie
people (that ſhould haue tilled the ground,
and might eaſily haue bene kept in order
without any daunger, by other good pollicies)
he was driuen afterwards many yeares
together, to vittaile the countrie (ſpecially
the great townes) out of his owne countrie
of Ruſſia, the ſoile lying there in the meane
while waſt, and vntilled.
            The like fell out at the port of Narue in
Liefland,
               Narue. where his ſonne Iuan Vaſilowich deuiſed

to build a towne, and a caſtle on the other
ſide the riuer, (called Iuangorod) to keepe
the towne, and countrie in ſubiection. The
Caſtle he cauſed to be ſo built, and fortified,
that it was thought to be inuincible. And
when it was finiſhed, for reward to the Architect
(that was a Polonian) he put out both
his eyes, to make him vnable to build the
like againe. But hauing left the natiues all
within their owne countrie, without abating
their number or ſtrength, the towne and caſtle
not long after was betrayed, and ſurrendred
againe to the king of Sweden.
            
            On the Southeſt ſide, they haue got the
kingdomes of Cazan, and Aſtracan. Theſe
were wonne from the Tartar, by the late
Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich, father to the
Emperour that now is: the one about 35,
the other about 33. yeares agoe. Northward
out of the countrie of Siberia, he hath layed
vnto his realme, a great breadth and length
of ground, from Wichida to the riuer of Obba,
about a 1000. miles ſpace: ſo that hee is
bold to write himſelfe now, The great Commaunder
of Siberia.
            
            The countries likewiſe of Permia,
               Permia and Pechora. and Pechora▪
               
are a diuers people and language from
the Ruſſe, ouercome not long ſince, and that
rather by threatning, and ſhaking of the
ſword, then by any actuall force: as being a

weake and naked people, without meanes to
reſiſt.
            That which the Ruſſe hath in his preſent
poſſeſsion,Meanes of holding his chiefe townes. hee keepeth on this ſorte.
In his foure chiefe border townes of Vobsko,
Smolensko, Aſtracan, and Cazan, he hath
certeine of his Counſell not of greateſt nobilitie,
but of greateſt truſt, which haue more
authoritie within their precincts (for the
countenauncing and ſtrengthning of their
gouernment there) then the other Dukes that
are ſet to gouerne in other places, as was noted
before, in the manner of ordering their
Prouinces. Theſe hee chaungeth ſometime
euery yeare, ſometime euery ſecond or third
yeare, but exceedeth not that time, except vpon
very ſpeciall truſt, and good liking of the
partie, and his ſeruice: leaſt by enlarging of
their time, they might grow into ſome familiaritie
with the enimie (as ſome haue done)
being ſo farre out of ſight.
            The townes beſides are very ſtrongly
fenced with trenches, caſtels, and ſtore of munition,
and haue garriſons within them, to
the nūber of two or three thouſand a piece.
They are ſtoared with vittaile if any ſiege
ſhould come vpon them, for the ſpace of two
or three yeares before hande. The foure Caſtels
of Smolensko, Vobsko, Cazan and Aſtracan,
he hath made very ſtrong to beare out

any ſiege: ſo that it is thought that thoſe
townes are impregnable.
            As for the countries of Pechora and Permia,
               Meanes of holding the countries of Pechora, Permia, and Siberia.
               
and that part of Siberia, which he hath
now vnder him, they are kept by as eaſie
meanes, as they were firſt got. vz. rather by
ſhewing, then by vſing of armes. Firſt, hee
hath ſtoared the Countrie with as manie
Ruſſes as there are natiues, and hath there
ſome fewe ſouldiers in garriſon, inough to
to keepe them vnder. Secondly, his officers
and Magiſtrates there, are of his owne Ruſſe
people, and hee chaungeth them very often,
vz. euery yeare twiſe or thriſe: notwithſtanding
there bee no great feare of any innouation.
Thirdly, he deuideth them into
many ſmall gouernments, like a ſtaffe broke
in many ſmall pieces: ſo that they haue no
ſtrength beyng ſeuered, which was but litle
neyther when they were all in one.
Fourthly, hee prouideth that the people of
the Countrie haue neither armour, nor monie,
beyng taxed and pilled ſo often as hee
thinketh good: without any means to ſhake
of that yoke, or to relieue themſelues.
            In Siberia (where he goeth on in purſuing
his conqueſt) he hath diuers caſtles and
garriſons, to the nūber of ſix thouſand ſouldiers
of Ruſſes, and Polonians, and ſendeth
many new ſupplies thither, to plant and to

inhabite, as he winneth ground. At this time
beſides he hath gotten the kings brother of
Siberia, allured by certeine of his Captaines,
to leaue his owne countrie by offers of great
intertainement, and pleaſanter life with the
Ruſſe Emperour, then he had in Siberia. He
was brought in this laſte yeare, and is now
with the Emperour at Mosko well interteyned.
            This may be ſayd of the Ruſſe practize,
whereſoeuer he ruleth, either by right of inheritance,
or by conqueſt. Firſt, he berieueth
the countrie of armour &amp; other means
of defence, which he permitteth to none, but
to his Botarskies onely. Secondly, he robbeth
them continually of their monie, and commodities,
and leaueth them bare with nothing
but their bodies, and liues, within certeine
yeares compaſſe. Thirdly, he renteth
and deuideth his territories into many ſmall
pieces by ſeuerall gouernments: ſo that none
hath much vnder him to make any ſtrength,
though he had other oportunities. Fourthly,
he gouerneth his Countries by men of
ſmall reputation, &amp; no power of themſelues,
and ſtraungers in thoſe places where their
gouernment lieth. Fiftly, he chaungeth his
gouernours once a yeare ordinarily, that
there grow no great liking nor intierneſſe
betwixt the people and them, nor acquaintance

with the enemy if they lie towards the
borders. Sixtly, he appointeth in one and
the ſame place aduerſarie gouernours, the
one to bee as Controller of the other, as
the Dukes and Diacks: where (by meanes
of their enuies and emulations) there is
leſſe hurt to bee feared by their agreement,
and himſelfe is better infourmed what is
done amiſſe. Seuenthly, he ſendeth many
times into euery Prouince ſecrete meſſengers
of ſpeciall truſt about him as intelligences,
to prie and harken out what is doing,
and what is a miſſe there. And this is ordinary,
though it be ſodaine, and vnknowen
what time they will come.
         
         
            Of the Tartars, and other borderers to the
Countrie of Ruſsia, with whome they
haue moſt to doo in warre, and peace.
            The 19. Chapter.
            
               THeir neighbours with whom
they haue greateſt dealings
&amp; intercourſe, both in peace
&amp; warre, are firſt the Tartar:
Secondly the Polonian whom
the Ruſſe calleth Laches,
               The Polonians called Laches by the Ruſſe.
                noting
the firſt author or founder of the Nation,

who was called Laches or Leches, whervnto
is added Po, which ſignifieth People, &amp;
ſo is made Polaches, that is, the People or poſteritie
of Laches: which the Latines after their
manner of writing call Polanos. The third
are the Swedens. The Polonians and Swedens
are better knowen to theſe partes of Europe
then are the Tartars, that are farther of
from vs (as being of Aſia) and diuided into
many tribes, different both in name, and
gouernment one from another. The greateſt
and mightieſt of them is the Chrim Tartar,
               
                  The Chrim Tartar.
(whom ſome call the Great Cham) that lieth
South, and Southeaſtward from Ruſſia, and
doth moſt annoy the Countrie by often inuaſions,
commonly once euery yeare, ſometimes
entring very farre within the inland
parts. In the yeare 1571. he came as farre as
the citie of Mosko, with an armie of 200000.
men, without any battaile, or reſiſtance at
all, for that the Ruſſe Emperour (then Iuan
Vaſilowich) leading foorth his armie to encounter
with him, marched a wrong way:
but as it was thought of very purpoſe, as not
daring to aduenture the fielde, by reaſon
that hee doubted his nobilitie, and chiefe
Captaines, of a meaning to betray him to
the Tartar.
            
            The citie he tooke not, but fired the Subburbs,
which by reaſon of the buildinges

(which is all of wood without any ſtone,The firing of Mosko by the Chrim Tartar, in the yeare 1571.
brick, or lime, ſaue certein out roomes) kindled
ſo quickly, and went on with ſuch rage as
that it cōſumed the greateſt part of the citie
almoſt within the ſpace of foure houres, being
of 30. miles or more of compaſſe. Then
might you haue ſeene a lamētable ſpectacle:
beſides the huge &amp; mighty flame of the citie
all on light fire, the people burning in their
houſes and ſtreates, but moſt of all of ſuch
as laboured to paſſe out of the gates fartheſt
from the enemie, where meeting together
in a mightie throng, and ſo preſsing euery
man to preuent another, wedged themſelues
ſo faſt within the gate, and ſtreates
neare vnto it, as that three ranks walked one
vpon the others head, the vppermoſt treading
downe thoſe that were lower: ſo that
there periſhed at that time (as was ſayd) by
the fire &amp; the preſſe, the number of 800000
people, or more.
            The Chrim thus hauing fired the Citie,
and fedde his eyes with the ſight of it all on
a light flame, returned with his armie, and
ſent to the Ruſſe Emperour a knife (as was
ſayd) to ſticke himſelfe withall: obbraiding
this loſſe, &amp; his deſperate caſe, as not daring
either to meet his enimy in the fielde, nor
to truſt his friends, or ſubiects at home. The
principall cauſe of this continual quarell betwixt

the Ruſſe and the Chrim, is for the right
of certeine border parts claimed by the Tartar,
but poſſeſſed by the Ruſſe. The Tartar alleageth
that beſides Aſtracan, &amp; Cazan (that
are the ancient poſeſsiō of the Eaſt Tartar)
the whole countrie from his bounds North
and Weſtward, ſo farre as the citie of Mosko,
and Mosko it ſelfe, perteineth to his right.
Which ſeemeth to haue bene true by the report
of the Ruſſes thēſelues,Homage done by the Ruſſe to the Chrim Tartar.
                that tell of a certeine
homage that was done by the Ruſſe Emperour
euery yeare, to the Great Chrim or
Cham, the Ruſſe Emperour ſtanding on foote
&amp; feeding the Chrims horſe, (himſelfe ſitting
on his back) with oates out of his owne cap,
in ſtead of a boule or maunger, &amp; that within
the caſtle of Mosko. And this homage (they
ſay) was done til the time of Baſileus grandfather
to this man. Who ſurpriſing the Chrim
Emperor by a ſtratagem, done by one of his
Nobilitie (called Iuan Demetrowich Belſchey)
was content with this raunſome, vz: with the
chaunging of this homage into a tribute of
furres: which afterwards alſo was denied to
be paied, by this Emperours father.
            Hereupon they continue the quarrell,
the Ruſſe defending his countrie, and that
which he hath wonne, the Chrim Tartar inuading
him once or twiſe euery yeare, ſometime
about Whitſontide, but oftener in Harueſt.

What time if the great Cham or Chrim
come in his owne perſon, he bringeth with
him a great armie of 100000. or 200000.
men. Otherwiſe they make ſhorte, and ſudden
roads into the countrie with leſſer numbers,
running about the liſt of the border as
wild geeſe flie, inuading and retiring where
they ſee aduantage.
            Their common practiſe (being very populous)
is to make diuers armies,The manner of the Tartars fight, and armour. &amp; ſo drawing
the Ruſſe to one, or two places of the frontiers,
to inuade at ſome other place, that is
left without defence. Their manner of fight,
or ordering of their forces, is much after the
Ruſſe manner (ſpoken of before) ſaue that
they are all horſemen, and carrie nothing els
but a bow, a ſheafe of arrowes, and a falcon
ſword after the Turkiſh faſhion. They are very
expert horſmē, &amp; vſe to ſhoot as readily backward,
as forward. Some wil haue a horſmans
ſtaffe like to a bore ſpeare, beſides their other
weapons. The cōmon ſouldier hath no
other armour then his ordinary apparel, vz:
a blacke ſheeps skin with the wooll ſide outward
in the day time, &amp; inward in the night
time, with a cap of the ſame. But their Morſeys
or Noblemen imitate the Turke both in apparel,
&amp; armour. When they are to paſſe ouer
a riuer with their armie, they tie three or
foure horſes together, &amp; taking long poles

or pieces of wood, bind them faſt to the tails
of their horſe: ſo ſitting on the poles they
driue their horſe ouer. At handie ſtrokes
(when they come to ioyne battaile) they are
accounted farre better men then the Ruſſe
people, fearſe by nature, but more hardie &amp;
blouddy by continuall practiſe of warre: as
men knowing no artes of peace, nor any ciuill
practiſe.
            Yet their ſubtiltie is more then may
ſeeme to agree with their barbarous condition.The ſubtiltie of the Tartar.
               
By reaſon they are practiſed to inuade
continually, and to robbe their neighbours
that border about them, they are very
pregnant, and ready witted to deuiſe ſtratageams
vpō the ſuddaine for their better aduantage.
As in their warre againſt Beala the
fourth king of Hungarie, whome they inuaded
with 500000. men, &amp; obteined againſt
him a great victorie. Where among other,
hauing ſlaine his Chauncellor, called Nicholas
Schinick, they founde about him the
Kings priuie ſeale. Whereupon they deuiſed
preſently to counterfait letters in the
Kings name, to the cities and townes next about
the place, where the field was foughtt
with charge that in no caſe they ſhould
conuey themſelues, and their goods out of
their dwellings, where they might abide
ſafely without all feare of daunger, and not

leaue the coūtrie deſolate to the poſſeſsion
of ſo vile &amp; barbarous an enimie, as was the
Tartar nation, terming themſelues in all reprochfull
manner. For notwithſtanding he
had loſt his carriages, with ſome fewe ſtraglers
that had marched diſorderly, yet hee
doubted not but to recouer that loſſe, with
the acceſſe of a notable victorie, if the ſauage
Tartar durſt abide him in the fielde.
To this purpoſe hauing written their letters
in the Poliſh character, by certaine young
men whom they tooke in the field, &amp; ſigned
them with the Kings ſeale, they diſpatched
them foorth to all the quarters of Hungarie,
that lay neare about the place. Whereupon
the Vngarians, that were now flying away
with their goods, wiues, &amp; children vpō
the rumour of the Kings ouerthrow, taking
comfort of theſe counterfait letters, ſtayed
at home. And ſo were made a pray, being
ſurpriſed on the ſuddaine by this huge number
of theſe Tartars, that had cōpaſſed them
about before they were aware.
            When they beſiege a towne or fort, they
offer much parle, and ſende many flattering
meſſages to perſwade a ſurrendry: promiſing
all things that the inhabitants will require:
but beyng once poſſeſſed of the place,
they vſe all manner of hoſtilitie, and erueltie.
This they doo vppon a rule they

haue, vz: that Iuſtice is to be practiſed but
towardes their owne. They encounter not
lightly, but they haue ſome ambuſh, wherevnto
(hauing once ſhewed themſelues, and
made ſome ſhort cōflict, they retire as repulfed
for feare, and ſo draw the enimie into it
if they can. But the Ruſſe being wel acquainted
with their practiſe, is more warie of them.
When they come a rouing with ſome ſmall
number, they ſet on horſebacke counterfait
ſhapes of men, that their number may ſeeme
greater.
            When they make any onſet, their manner
is to make a great ſhoote, crying all out
together Olla Billa, Olla Billa, God helpe vs,
God helpe vs. They contemne death ſo much,
as that they chuſe rather to die, then to yeeld
to their enimie, and are ſeene when they are
ſlaine to bite the very weapon, when they
are paſt ſtriking, or helping of themſelues.
Wherein appeareth how different the Tartar
is in his deſperate courage from the
Ruſſe, and Turke. For the Ruſſe Souldier if
he begin once to retire putteth all his ſafety
in his ſpeedie flight. And if once he be taken
by his enemie, he neyther defendeth himſelfe,
nor intreateth for his life, as reckoning
ſtraight to die. The Turke commonly
when he is paſt hope of eſcaping, falleth to
intreatie, and caſteth awaie his weapon,

offereth both his handes, and holdeth them
vp, as it were to be tyed: hoping to ſaue his
life, by offering himſelfe bondſlaue.
            The chiefe bootie the Tartars ſeeke for
in all their warres, is to get ſtore of captiues,
ſpecially yong boyes, and girls, whom they
ſell to the Turkes, or other their neighbors.
To this purpoſe they take with them great
baskets made like bakers panniers to carrie
them tenderly, and if any of them happen to
tyer, or to be ſicke on the way, they daſh
him againſt the ground, or ſome tree, and
ſo leaue him dead: The ſouldiers are not
troubled with keeping the captiues, and the
other bootie, for hindering the execution
of their warres, but they haue certein bands
that intend nothing els, appointed of purpoſe
to receiue, and keepe the captiues and
the other praye.
            The Ruſſe borders (being vſed to their inuaſions
lightly euery yeere in the ſommer)
keepe fewe other cattel on the border parts,The Tartar religion.
ſaue ſwine onely, which the Tartar will not
touch, nor driue away with him: for that he
is of the Turkiſh religion, and will eate no
ſwines fleſh. Of Chriſt our Sauiour they confeſſe
aſmuch as doeth the Turke in his Alkaron,
vz. that hee came of the Angell Gabriel,
and the Virgin Marie, that hee was a great
Prophet, and ſhalbe the Iudge of the world

at the laſt day. In other matters likewiſe, they
are much ordered after the manner and direction
of the Turke: hauing felt the Turkiſh
forces when hee wonne from them Azou,
&amp; Caffa, with ſome other townes about
the Euxine, or Blacke ſea, that were before
tributaries to the Chrim Tartar. So that now
the Emperour of the Chrims for the moſt
part is choſen ſome one of the Nobilitie
whom the Turke doeth commend: whereby
it is brought nowe to that paſſe, that the
Chrim Tartar giueth to the Turke the tenth
part of the ſpoyle, which hee getteth in his
warres againſt the Chriſtians.
            Herein they differ from the Turkiſh religion,
for that they haue certeine idole puppets
made of ſilke, or like ſtuffe, of the faſhion
of a man, which they faſten to the doore
of their walking houſes, to be as Ianuſſes or
keepers of their houſe. And theſe idols are
made not by all, but by certeine religious
women, which they haue among them for
that, &amp; like vſes. They haue beſides the image
of their King or great Cham, of an huge bignes
which they erect at euery ſtage: when the
army marcheth: &amp; this euery one muſt bend
and bowe vnto as hee paſſeth by it, bee
he Tartar, or ſtranger. They are much giuen
to witchcraft, &amp; ominous coniectures, vpon
euery accident which they heare, or ſee.
            
               
In making of mariages they haue no
regard of alliance or conſanguinitie. Onely
with his mother, ſiſter, and daughter a man
may not marrie, and though hee take the
woman into his houſe, and accompany with
her, yet hee accounteth her not for his wife,
till he haue a childe by her. Then he beginneth
to take a dowrie of her friendes of
horſe, ſheepe, kyne, &amp;c. If ſhe be barren after
a certeine time, he turneth her home againe.
            Vnder the Emperour they haue certeine
Dukes,The Tartar Nobilitie. whome they call Morſeis or Diuoymorſeis:
that rule ouer a certeine number of
10000. 20000. or 40000. a piece, which they
call hoords. When the Emperour hath any
vſe of them to ſerue in his warres, they are
bound to come, &amp; to bring with them their
ſouldiers to a certeine nomber, euery man
with his two horſe at the leaſt, the one to
ride on, the other to kill, when it commeth
to his turne to haue his his horſe eate. For
their chiefe vittaile is horſe fleſh,The Tartar dyet. which they
eate without bread, or any other thing with
it. So that if a Tartar be taken by a Ruſſe, he
ſhall be ſure lightly to finde a horſe legge, or
ſome other part of him at his ſaddle bow.
            This laſt yeere when I was at the Mosko,
came in one Kiriach Morſey, nephewe to the
Emperour of the Chrims that now is (whoſe
father was Emperour before) accompanied

with 300. Tartars, and his two wiues, whereof
one was his brothers widdow. Where being
intertained in very good ſort after the
Ruſſe manner; hee had ſent vnto his lodging
for his welcome, to bee made ready for his
ſupper and his companies, two very large
and fatte horſes, ready flawed in a ſledde.
They preferre it before other fleſh, becauſe
the meate is ſtronger (as they ſay)
then beefe, mutton, and ſuch like. And
yet (which is marueile) though they ſerue all
as horſemen in the warres, and eate all of
horſe fleſh, there are brought yeerely to the
Mosko to be exchanged for other cōmodities
30. or 40. thouſand Tartar horſe, which
they call Cones. They keepe alſo great heards
of kine, and flockes of blacke ſheepe, rather
for the skins and milke (which they carry
with them in great bottels) then for the vſe
of the fleſh, though ſometimes they eate of
it. Some vſe they haue of ryſe figs, and other
fruites. They drinke milke or warme blood,
and for the moſt part carde them both together.
They vſe ſometimes as they traueile
by the way, to let their horſe blood in a
vain, and to drinke it warme, as it commeth
from his body.
            Townes they plant none,The Tartars dwelling. nor other ſtanding
buildings, but haue walking houſes
which the Latines call Veij, built vpon

wheeles like a ſhepheards cottage. Theſe
they drawe with them whitherſoeur they
goe, driuing their cattaile with them. And
when they come to their ſtage, or ſtanding
place, they plant their cart houſes very
orderly in a ranke: and ſo make the forme of
ſtreetes, and of a large towne. And this is the
manner of the Emperour himſelfe, who hath
no other ſeat of his Empire but an Agora, or
towne of wood, that moueth with him whitherſoeuer
hee goeth. As for the fixed and
ſtanding building vſed in other countreys,
they ſay they are vnwholſome and vnpleaſant.
            They beginne to mooue their houſes and
cattaile in the ſpring time from the South
part of their Countrey towards the North
parts. And ſo driuing on til they haue graſed
all vp to the fartheſt part Northwarde, they
returne backe againe towardes their South
countrey (where they continue all the winter)
by ten or twelue miles a ſtage: in the
meane while the graſſe being ſprung vp againe,
to ſerue for their cattaile as they returne.
From the border of the Shalcan towards
the Caſpian ſea, to the Ruſſe frontiers,
they haue a goodly Countrey, ſpecially on
the South and Southeaſt partes, but loſt for
lacke of tillage.
            Of money they haue no vſe at all, and

therefore preferre braſſe and ſteele before
other mettals, ſpecially bullate, which they
vſe for ſwords, kniues, and other neceſſaries.
As for golde and ſiluer they neglect it of very
purpoſe, (as they doe all tillage of their
ground) to be more free for their wandring
kinde of life, and to keepe their Countrey
leſſe ſubiect to inuaſiōs. Which giueth them
great aduantage againſt all their neighbors,
euer inuading, &amp; neuer being inuaded. Such
as haue taken vpon them to inuade their
Countrey (as of olde time Cyrus and Darius
Hyſtaſpis, on the Eaſt and Southeaſt ſide)
haue done it with very ill ſucceſſe: as we find
in the ſtories written of thoſe times. For
their manner is when any will inuade them,
to allure and drawe them on by flying and
reculing (as if they were afraide) till they
haue drawen them ſome good way within
their countrey. Then when they beginne to
want vittaile and other neceſſaries (as needs
they muſt where nothing is to bee had) to
ſtoppe vp the paſſages, and incloſe them
with multitudes. By which ſtratagem (as we
reade in Laonicus Chalcacondylas in his Turkiſh
ſtorie) they had welnigh ſurpriſed the
great aud huge armie of Tamerlan, but that
hee retyred with all ſpeede hee coulde, towardes
the riuer Tanais, or Don, not without
great loſſe of his men, and carriages.
            
               
In the ſtorie of Pachymerius the Greeke
(which he wrote of the Emperours of Conſtantinople
from the beginning of the reigne
of Michael Palaeologus to the time of Andronicus
the elder) I remember hee telleth to
the ſame pourpoſe of one Nogas a Tartarian
captaine vnder Cazan the Emperour of
the Eaſt Tartars (of whome the Citie and
kingdome of Cazan may ſeeme to haue taken
the denomination) who refuſed a preſent
of Pearle and other iewels ſent vnto
him from Michael Palaeologus: asking withall,
for what vſe they ſerued, and whither
they were good to keepe away ſickneſſe,
death, or other misfortunes of this life, or
no. So that it ſeemeth they haue, euer or
long time bene of that minde to value things
no further, then by the vſe, and neceſsitie
for which they ſerue.
            For perſon and complexion they haue
broad and flatte viſages, of a tanned colour
into yellowe and blacke, fearſe and cruell
lookes, thin haired vpon the vpper lippe,
and pitte of the chinne, light and nimble
bodied, with ſhort legges, as if they were
made naturally for horſemen: whereto they
practiſe themſelues from their childehood,
ſeldome going afoote about any buſineſſe.
Their ſpeach is very ſuddaine and loude,
ſpeaking as it were out of a deepe hollowe

throate. When they ſing you woulde thinke
a kowe lowed, or ſome great bandogge
howled. Their greateſt exerciſe is ſhooting,
wherein they traine vp their children from
their very infancie, not ſuffering them to
eate, til they haue ſhot neere the marke within
a certein ſcātling. They are the very ſame
that ſometimes were called Scythae Nomades,
or the Scythian Shepheards, by the Greeks
and Latines. Some thinke that the Turkes
tooke their beginning from the nation of
the Chrim Tartars. Of which opinion is Laonicus
Chalcocondylas the Greeke Hiſtoriographer,
in his firſt booke of his Turkiſh
ſtorie. Wherein hee followeth diuers
very probable coniectures: The firſt taken
from the very name it ſelfe, for that
the worde Turke ſignifieth a ſhepheard, or
one that foloweth a vagrant and wilde kinde
of life By which name theſe Scythian Tartars
haue euer bene noted, being called by the
Greekes 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or the Scythian ſhepheards.
His ſecond reaſon, becauſe the Turks
(in his time) that dwelt in Aſia the leſſe, to
wit, in Lydia, Coria, Phrygia, and Cappadocia,
ſpake the very ſame language that theſe Tartars
did, that dwelt betwixt the riuer Tanais
or Don. and the countrey of Sarmatia, which
(as is well knowen) are theſe Tartars called
Chrims. At this time alſo the whole nation

of the Turkes differ not much in their common
ſpeach from the Tartar lāguage, Thirdly
becauſe the Turke and the Chrim Tartar
agree ſo well together, aſwell in religion, as
in matter of traffique neuer inuading, or
iniurying one another: ſaue that the Turke
(ſince Laonicus his time) hath encroached vpon
ſome Townes vpon the Euxin ſea, that
before perteined to the Chrim Tartar.
Fourthly, becauſe Ortogules ſonne to Oguzalpes,
&amp; (father to Otoman the firſt of name
of the Turkiſh nation) made his firſt roads
out of thoſe partes of Aſia, vpon the next
borderers, till he came towardes the countreys
about the hill Taurus, where hee ouercame
the Greeks that inhabited there: and ſo
enlarged the name and territorie of the
Turkiſh nation, til he came to Eubaa and Attica,
and other partes of Greece. This is the
opinion of Laonicus, who liued among the
Turks in the time of Amurat the ſixt Turkiſh
Emperour, about the yeere 1400. when the
memorie of their originall was more freſh:
and therefore the likelier hee was to hit the
trueth.
            There are diuers other Tartars that border
vpon Ruſsia, as the Nagaies, the Cheremiſsens,
the Mordwites, the Chircaſses, and
the Shalcans, which all differ in name more
then in regiment, or other condition, from

the Chrim Tartar except the Chircaſſes that
border Southweſt,The Nagay Tartar the cruelleſt. towardes Lituania, and
are farre more ciuil then the reſt of the Tartars,
               The Chircaſce the ciuileſt Tartar.
               
of a comely perſon, and of a ſtately behauiour,
as applying themſelues to the
faſhion of the Polonian. Some of them haue
ſubiected themſelues to the kings of Poland,
&amp; profeſſe Chriſtianitie. The Nagay lyeth
Eaſtwarde, and is reckoned for the beſt man
of warre among all the Tartars, but verie ſauage,
                  The Cheremiſsen Tartar.
and cruell aboue all the reſt. The Cheremifrn
Tartar, that lieth betwixt the Ruſſe &amp;
the Nagay, are of two ſorts, the Lugauoy (that
is of the valley) and the Nagornay, or of the
hillie countrey. Theſe haue much troubled
the Emperours of Ruſſia. And therfore they
are content now to buy peace of thē, vnder
pretence of giuing a yeerely penſion of Ruſſe
commodities, to their Morſeis, or Diuoymorſeis,
that are chiefe of their tribes For which
alſo they are boūd to ſerue thē in their wars,
vnder certeine conditions. They are ſaide to
be iuſt &amp; true in their dealings: and for that
cauſe they hate the Ruſſe people, whom they
account to be double, &amp; falſe in all their dealing.
And therfore the common ſort are very
vnwilling to keep agreement with them, but
that they are kept in by their Morſeis, or
Dukes for their penſions ſake.
            The moſt rude &amp; barbarous is coūted the

               Mordwit Tartar,
               The Mordwite Tartar the moſt barbarous of the reſt. that hath many ſelf faſhiōs,
&amp; ſtrange kinds of behauiour, differing frō
the reſt. For his religiō, thogh he acknowlege
one god, yet his maner is to worſhip for god,
that liuing thing, that he firſt meeteth in the
morning &amp; to ſweare by it al that whole day
whether it be horſe, dogge, catte, or whatſoeuer
els it be. When his friend dieth, he killeth
his beſt horſe, and hauing flayed off the
skin he carrieth it on high vpon a long pole,
before the corpes to the place of buriall.
This hee doeth (as the Ruſſe ſayeth) that
his friend may haue a good horſe to carie
him to heauen: but it is likelier to declare his
loue towardes his dead friende, in that hee
will haue to die with him the beſt thing that
hee hath.
            Next to the kingdome of Aſiracan, that
is the fartheſt part Southeaſtward of the
Ruſſe dominion, lyeth the Shalcan, and the
countrey of Midia: whither the Ruſſe marchants
trade for raw ſilks, ſyndon, ſaphion,
skins, and other commodities. The chiefe
townes of Media where the Ruſſe tradeth,
are, Derbent (built by Alexander the great,
as the inhabitauntes ſaye) and Zamachie
where the ſtaple is kept for rawe ſilkes.
Their manner is in the Spring time to reuiue
the ſilke-wormes (that lye dead all the
Winter) by laying them in the warme

ſunne, and (to haſten their quickening that
they may ſooner goe to worke) to put them
into bags, and ſo to hang them vnder their
childrens armes. As for the worme called
Chriniſin (as we call it chrymſon) that maketh
coloured ſilke, it is bred not in Media, but
in Aſsyria. This trade to Derbent and Samachie
for rawe ſilkes, and other commodities,
of that countrey, as alſo into Perſia,
and Bougharia, downe the riuer Volgha, and
through the Caſpian ſea, is permitted aſwell
to the Engliſh, as to the Ruſſe marchants,
by the Emperours laſt Graunt at my being
there. Which hee accounteth for a very ſpeciall
fauour, and might prooue in deede very
beneficiall to our Engliſh marchants, if
the trade were wel, and orderly vſed.
            
               The whole nation of the Tartars are vtterly
voyde of all learning, and without
written Lawe. Yet certeine rules they haue
which they holde by tradition, common
to all the Hoords for the practiſe of their life.
Which are of this ſort. Firſt, To obey their
Emperour and other Magiſtrates, whatſoeuer
they commaunde about the publique ſeruice.
2. Except for the publique behoofe, euery man
to be free and out of controlement. 3. No priuate
man to poſſeſſe any lands, but the whole
countrey to be as a common. 4. To neglect all
daintineſſe and varietie of meates, and to content

themſelues with that which commeth next to
hand, for more hardneſſe, and readineſſe in the
executing of their affaires. 5. To weare any
baſe attire, and to patch their clothes, whether
there bee anie neede or not: that when there
is neede, it bee no ſhame to weare a patcht coate.
6 To take, or ſteale from anie ſtranger whatſoeuer
they can gette, as beeyng enemies to all
men, ſaue to ſuch as will ſubiect themſelues to
them. 7. Towardes their owne hoorde and nation
to be true in word, and deede. 8. To ſuffer no
ſtranger to come within the Realme, If
any doe, the ſame to bee bondſlaue to
him that firſt taketh him, except
ſuch marchants and
other as haue the Tartar
Bull, or paſtport
about
them.
         
         
            
            Of the Permians, Samoites,
Of the Permians, Samoites,
and Lappes.
            The 20. Chapter.
            
               THe Permians &amp;
Samoits that lye
frō 
               Ruſſia, north
&amp; Northeaſt, are
thought likewiſe
to haue takē
their beginning
from the
Tartar kind. And
it may partly be
geſſed by the faſhion of their countenance,
as hauing all broade, &amp; flat faces, as the Tartars
haue,The Permans.
                except the Chirchaſſes. The Permians
are accounted for a very ancient people.
They are now ſubiect to the Ruſſe. They liue
by hunting, and trading with their furres, as
doth also the Samoyt, that dwelleth more towardes
the North ſea.The Samoites.
                The Samoyt hath his
name (as the Ruſſe ſaith) of eating himſelfe:
as if in times paſt, they liued as the Cannibals,
eating one another. Which they make
more probable, becauſe at this time they eat
all kind of raw fleſh, whatſoeuer it bee, euen
the very carion that lieth in the ditch. But

as the Samoits themſelues wil ſay, they were
called Samoie, that is of themſelues, as though
they were Indigenae, or people bredde vpon
that very ſoyle, that neuer changed their ſeat
from one place to another, as moſt nations
haue done. They are ſubiect at this time to
the Emperour of Ruſſia,
            
            I talked with certeine of them, and finde
that they acknowledge one God:The Samoites religion. but repreſent
him by ſuch things as they haue moſt vſe
and good by. And therfore they worſhip the
Sun, the Ollen, the Loſh, and ſuch like. As for
the ſtorie of Slata Baba,
               
                  Slata Baba or the golden Hag. or the Golden hagge.
(which I haue read in ſome mappes, and deſcriptions
of theſe countries, to bee an idole
after the forme of an olde woman) that being
demaunded by the Prieſt, giueth them
certeyne Oracles, concerning the ſucceſſe,
and euent of thinges, I haue founde it to
bee but a verye fable. Onelie in the Prouince
of Obdoria vpon the Sea ſide, neare
to the mouth of the great riuer Obba, there
is a rocke, which naturally (beeing ſomewhat
helped by imagination) may ſeeme to
beare the ſhape of a ragged woman, with a
child in her armes (as the rock by the North
cape the ſhape of a Frier) where the Obdorian
Samoites vſe much to reſort, by reaſon
of the commoditie of the place for
fiſhing: and there ſometime (as their manner

is) conceiue, and practiſe their ſorceries,
and ominous coniecturings about the good,
or bad ſpeed of their iourneies, fiſhings, huntings,
and ſuch like,
            They are clad in Seale skins,The Samoits habite and behauiour. with the hearie
ſide outwards downe as low as the knees,
with their breeches and netherſtocks of the
ſame, both men and women. They are all
blacke haired, naturally beardleſſe. And
therefore the men are hardly diſcerned from
the women by their looks: ſaue that the women
weare a lock of haire down along both
their eares. They liue in a maner a wilde and
a ſauage life, rouing ſtil from one place of the
countrey to another, without anie propertie
of houſe or land more to one then to an
other. Their leader or directer in euery companie,
is their Papa or Prieſt.
            On the North ſide of Ruſſia next to Corelia,
               The Lappes.
               
lieth the countrey of Lappia, which reacheth
in length from the fartheſt poynt
Northward, (towardes the Northcape) to
the fartheſt part Southeaſt (which the Ruſſe
calleth Sweetneſſe or Holie noſe, the Engliſh
men Capegrace) about 345. verſt or miles. Frō
               Sweetneſſe to Candelox by the way of Verſega
(which meaſureth the breadth of that countrey)
is 90. miles or there abouts. The whole
countrey in a manner is eyther lakes, or
mountaines, which towardes the Sea ſide

are called Tondro, becauſe they are all of hard
and craggy rocke, but the inland partes are
well furniſhed with woods, that growe on
the hilles ſides, the lakes lying betweene.
Their diet is very bare &amp; ſimple. Bread they
haue none, but feed onely vpon fiſh &amp; fowle.
They are ſubiect to the Emperour of Ruſſia,
and the two Kings of Sweden, and Denmark:
which all exact tribute and cuſtome of them
(as was ſaid before) but the Emperour of
Ruſſia beareth the greateſt hand ouer them,
and exact of them farre more then the reſt.
The opinion is that they were firſt termed
Lappes of their briefe and ſhort ſpeach. The
Ruſſe deuideth the whole natiō of the Lappes
into two ſorts. The one they call Nowremanſkoy
Lapary, that is, the Noruegian Lappes: becauſe
they be of the Daniſh religion. For the
Danes and Noruegians they account for one
people. The other that haue no religion at
all, but liue as brute and Heatheniſh people,
without God in the world, they call Dikoy
Lopary, or the wild Lappes.
            
            The whole nation is vtterly vnlearned,
hauing not ſo much as the vſe of any Alphabet,
or letter among them. For practiſe of
witchcraft and sorcery, they paſſe all nations
in the world. Though for the enchaunting of
ſhippes that ſaile along their coaſt (as I haue
heard it reported) and their giuing of winds

good to their friends, and contrary to other,
whom they meane to hurt by tying of certein
knots vpon a rope (ſomewhat like to the tale
of Aeolus his windbag) is a very fable, deuiſed
(as may ſeeme) by themſelues, to terrifie
ſailers for comming neare their coaſt. Their
weapons are the long bow, and handgunne,
wherein they excell, aſwell for quicknes to
charge and diſcharge, as for nearneſſe at the
marke, by reaſon of their cōntinuall practiſe
(wherto they are forced) of ſhooting at wild
fowle. Their manner is in Sommer time to
come downe in great companies to the ſea
ſide, to Wardhuyſe, Cola, Kegor, and the bay of
Vedagoba, &amp; there to fiſh for Codd, Salmon, &amp;
But-fiſh, which they ſell to the Ruſſes, Danes,
&amp; Noruegians, and now of late to the Engliſh
mē that trade thither with cloth, which they
exchaunge with the Lappes and Corelians for
their fiſh, oile, and furres, whereof alſo they
haue ſome ſtore. They hold their mart at Cola
on S. Peters day: what time the Captain of
Wardhuyſe (that is reſiant there for the king
of Denmarke) muſt be preſent, or at leaſt ſend
his deputie to ſet prices vpon their ſtockfiſh,
traine oile, furres, and other commodities: as
alſo the Ruſſe Emperours cuſtomer, or tribute
taker, to receiue his cuſtome, which is
euer payed before any thing can be bought,
or ſold, When their fiſhing is done, their mā
               ner

is to drawe their carbaſſes, or boates on
ſhoare, &amp; there to leaue them with the keele
turned vpwardes, till the next ſpring tide.
Their trauaile too &amp; fro is vpon ſleds, drawen
by the Olen deer: which they vſe to turne
a graſing all the Sommer time, in an iland called
Kilden (of a very good ſoile compared
with other partes of that countrie) and towards
the winter time, when the ſnow beginneth
to fall, they fetch them home again,
for the vſe of their ſledde.
         
         
            Of their Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, with
their Church offices.
            The 21. Chapter.
            
               COncerning the
gouernement of
their Churche, it
is framed altogether
after the mā
               ner
of the Greek:
as being a part of
that Church, and
neuer acknowledging
the iuriſdiction
of the Latine Church, vſurped by the
Pope. That I may keepe a better meaſure in

deſcribing their ceremonies, thē they in the
vſing them (wherein they are infinite) I will
note briefly: Firſt, what Eccleſiaſticall degrees,
or offices they haue with the iuriſdiction,
and practiſe of them. Secondly, what
doctrine they holde in matter of religion.
Thirdly, what leiturgie, or forme of ſeruice
they vſe in their Churches, with the manner
of their adminiſtring the Sacramēts. Fourthly,
what other ſtraunge ceremonies, and ſuperſtitious
deuotions are vſed among them.
            Their offices,The church officers. or degrees of Churchmen,
are as many in number, and the ſame in a
manner both in name and degree, that were
in the Weſterne churches. Firſt they haue
their Patriarch, then their Metropolites, their
Archbiſhops, their Vladikey or Biſhops, their
Protopapes or Archprieſts, their Papes or
Prieſts, their Deacons, Friers, Monkes, Nunnes,
and Eremites.
            
            Their Patriarch,
               The Patriarch. or chiefe directer in matter
of religion vntill this laſt yeare, was of
the citie of Conſtantinople (whom they called
the Patriarch of Sio) becauſe being driuen by
the Turke out of Conſtantinople (the ſeate of
his Empire) he remoued to the Ile Sio, ſometimes
called Chio, and there placed his Patriarchiall
ſea. So that the Emperours, and clergie
of Ruſſia, were wont yearely to ſend gifts
thither, and to acknowledge a ſpirituall
kind of homage, and ſubiection due to him,

and to that Church. Which cuſtome they
haue held (as it ſeemeth) euer ſince they profeſſed
the Chriſtian religiō. Which how long
it hath bene I could not well learne, for that
they haue no ſtorie, or monument of antiquitie
(that I could heare of) to ſhewe what
hath bene done in times paſt within their
countrie concerning either Church, or common
wealth matters. Onely I heare a report
among them, that about three hundred
yeares ſince, there was a marriage betwixt
the Emperour of Conſtantinople, &amp; the kings
daughter of that countrie: who at the firſt
denied to ioyne his daughter in marriage
with the Greeke Emperour, becauſe he was of
the Chriſtian religion. Which agreeth well
with that I finde in the ſtorie of Laonicus
Chalcacondylas concerning Turkiſh affaires
in his fourth booke: where hee ſpeaketh of
ſuch a marriage betwixt Iohn the Greeke
Emperour, and the Kings daughter of Sarmatia.
And this argueth out of their owne
report, that at that time they had not receyued
the Chriſtian religion: as alſo that they
were conuerted to the faith, and withall peruerted
at the very ſame time, receyuing the
doctrine of the goſpell, corrupted with ſuperſtitions
euen at the firſt when they tooke it
from the Greeke Church, which it ſelfe then
was degenerate, and corrupted with many

ſuperſtitions, and fowle errours, both in doctrine
and diſcipline: as may appeare by the
ſtory of Nicephorus Gregoras, in his 8. and 9.
bookes. But as touching the time of their
conuerſion to the chriſtiā faith, I ſuppoſe rather
that it is miſtaken by the Ruſſe, for that
which I find in the Polonian ſtorie, the ſecōd
booke the third chapter: where is ſaid that about
the yeare 990. Vlodomirus Duke of Ruſſia,
married one Anne ſiſter to Baſilius, and
Conſtantinus brothers, &amp; Emperours of Conſtantinople.
Wherupon the Ruſſe receiued the
faith &amp; profeſsion of Chriſt. Which though
it be ſomewhat more auncient then the time
noted before out of the Ruſſe report, yet it
falleth out al to one reckoning, touching this
point, vz: in what truth and ſinceritie of doctrine
the Ruſſe receiued the firſt ſtampe of
religion: for aſmuch as the Greeke church at
that time alſo was many waies infected with
errour, and ſuperſtition.
            At my being there,The tranſlation of the Patriarchicall ſea from Conſtantinople or Sio, to Mosko.
                the yere 1588 came vnto
the Mosko the Patriarch of Conſtātinople, or
Sio) called Hieronomo being baniſhed as ſome
ſaid) by the Turke, as ſome other reported by
the Greeke clergie depriued. The Emp. being
giuen altogether to ſuperſtitious deuotions,
gaue him great intertainment. Before his cō
               ming
to Mosko, he had bene in Italy with the
Pope, as was reported ther by ſome of his cō
               pany.

His arrād was to cōſult with the Emp.
concerning theſe points. Firſt about a league
to paſſe betwixt him &amp; the king of Spaine, as
the meeteſt Prince to ioyne with him in oppoſition
againſt the Turke. To which purpoſe
alſo Ambaſſages had paſſed betwixt the
Ruſſe &amp; the Perſian. Likewiſe from the Georgians
to the Emperour of Ruſſia, to ioyne
league together, for the inuading of the
Turke on all ſides of his dominion: taking
the aduantage of the ſimple qualitie of the
Turke that now is. This treatie was helped
forward by the Emperours Ambaſſadour of
Almaine, ſent at the ſame time to ſolicite an
inuaſion vpon the parts of Polonia, that lie
towards Ruſland, and to borrow mony of the
Ruſſe Emperour, to purſue the warre for his
brother Maximilian, againſt the Swedens ſon
now king of Poland. But this conſultation
concerning a league betwixt the Ruſſe &amp; the
Spaniard, (which was in ſome forwardnes at
my comming to Mosko, and already one appointed
for Ambaſſage into Spaine) was marred
by means of the ouerthrow giuen to the
Spaniſh king by her Maieſtie, the Queene of
England, this laſt yeare. Which made the
Ruſſe Emperour and his Counſell, to giue a
ſadder countenance to the Engliſh Ambaſſadour
at that time: for that they were diſappointed
of ſo good a policie, as was this coniunction

ſuppoſed to bee betwixt them and
the Spaniſh.
            
            His ſecond purpoſe (whereto the firſt
ſerued as an introduction) was in reuenge
of the Turke and the Greeke cleargie, that
had thruſt him from his ſeat, to treate with
them about the reducing of the Ruſſe church
vnder the Pope of Rome. Wherein it may
ſeeme that comming lately from Rome, he
was ſet on by the Pope, who hath attempted
the ſame many times before, though all
in vaine: and namely in the time of the late
Emperour Iuan Vaſilowich, by one Anthony
his Legate. But thought this belike a farre
better meane to obteine his purpoſe by treatie
and mediation of their owne Patriarch.
But this not ſucceeding, the Patriarch fell to
a third point of treatie, concerning the reſignation
of his Patriarchſhip, &amp; tranſlation
of the Sea from Conſtantinople, or Sio, to the
citie of Mosko. Which was ſo well liked, and
intertained by the Emperour (as a matter of
high religion, &amp; pollicie) that no other treatie
(ſpecially of forrein Ambaſſages) could
be heard, or regarded, till that matter was
concluded.
            The reaſon wherewith the Patriarch perſwaded
the tranſlating of his Sea to the citie
of Mosko, were theſe in effect. Firſt, for that
the Sea of the Patriarch was vnder the Turk
               
that is enemie to the faith. And therefore to
bee remoued into ſome other countrie of
Chriſtian profeſsion. Secondly, becauſe the
Ruſſe church was the only naturall daughter
of the Greeke at this time, and holdeth the
ſame doctrine &amp; ceremonies with it the reſt
being all ſubiect to the Turke, and fallen away
from the right profeſsion. Wherein the
ſubtill Greeke to make the better market of
his broken ware, aduaunced the honour
that would growe to the Emperour, and his
countrie: to haue the Patriarches ſeat, tranſlated
into the chief citie, and ſeat of his Empire.
As for the right of tranſlating the ſea,
and appointing his ſucceſſour, hee made no
doubt of it, but that it perteyned wholy to
himſelfe.
            So the Emperour, &amp; his Counſell,The Patriarchſhip of Conſtantinople tranſlated to Moſko.
                with the
principall of his cleargie being aſſembled at
the Mosko, it was determined that the Metropolite
of Mosko, ſhould become Patriarch
of the whole Greeke Church, and haue the
ſamefull authoritie, &amp; iuriſdiction that perteined
before to the Patriarch of Conſtantinople,
or Sio. And that it might bee done with
more order, &amp; ſolemnitie, the 25. of Ianuary,
1588. the Greeke Patriarch accōpanied with
the Ruſſe Cleargie, went to the great Church
of Precheſte, or our Ladie, within the Emperours
caſtle (hauing firſt wandred thorough

the whole citie in manner of a proceſsion,
and bleſsing the people with his two fingers)
where hee made an Oration, and deliuered
his reſignation in an inſtrument of writing,
and ſo laied downe his Patriarchicall ſtaffe.
Which was preſently receiued by the Metropolite
of Mosko, and diuers other ceremonies
vſed about the inauguration of this new
Patriarch.
            The day was holden very ſolemne by the
people of the citie, who were cōmaunded to
forbeare their workes, and to attend this ſolemnitie.
The great Patriarch that day was
honoured with rich preſents ſent him from
the Emperour and Empreſſe, of plate, cloth
of gold, furres, &amp;c: carried with great pompe
thorough the ſtreats of Mosko and at his departing
receiued many giftes more, both
from the Emperour, Nobilitie, and Cleargie.
Thus the Patriarchſhip of Conſtantinople,
or Sio, (which hath continued ſince the
Counſell of Nice) is now tranſlated to Moſko,
or they made beleeue that they haue a
Patriarch with the ſame right and authoritie
that the other had. Wherin the ſubtil Greeke
hath made good aduantage of their ſuperſtition,
and is now gone away with a rich
bootie into Poland, whither their Patriarchſhip
be currant or not.
            The matter is not vnlike to make ſome

ſchiſme betwixt the Greeke &amp; Ruſſe Church,
if the Ruſſe holde this Patriarchſhip that he
hath ſo well payed for, and the Greekes elect
an other withall, as likely they will, whither
this man were baniſhed by the Turke,
or depriued by order of his owne Cleargie.
Which might happen to giue aduantage to
the Pope, &amp; to bring ouer the Ruſſe Church
to the ſea of Rome (to which end peraduenture
he deuiſed this ſtratageam, and caſt in
this matter of ſchiſme among them) but that
the Emperours of Ruſſia know well enough,
by the exāple of other chriſtian Princes, what
inconuenience would grow to their ſtate &amp;
coūtrie, by ſubiecting themſelues to the Romiſh
ſea. To which ende the late Emperour
Iuan Vaſilowich was very inquiſitiue of the
Popes authority ouer the Princes of chriſtendome,
&amp; ſent one of very purpoſe to Rome,
to behold the order, &amp; behauior of his court.
            With this Patriarch Hieronimo was driuen
out at the ſame time by the great Turke, one
Demetrio Archbiſhop of Lariſſa: who is now
in England, &amp; pretendeth the ſame cauſe of
their baniſhment by the Turke (to wit) their
not admitting of the Popes new Kalender,
for the alteration of the yeare. Which how
vnlikely it is, may appeare by theſe circumſtances.
Firſt, becauſe there is no ſuch affection,
nor friendlie reſpect betwixt the

Pope &amp; the Turke, as that he ſhould baniſh a
ſubiect for not obeying the Popes ordināce,
ſpecially in a matter of ſome ſequele for the
alteration of times within his owne countries.
Secondly, for that he maketh no ſuch
ſcruple in deducting of times, and keeping
of a iuſt and preciſe account from the incarnatiō
of Chriſt: whom he doth not acknowledge
otherwiſe then I noted before Thirdly,
for that the ſaid Patriarch is now at Naples
in Italy, where it may be gheſſed he would
not haue gone within the Popes reach, and
ſo neare to his noſe, if he had bene baniſhed
for oppoſing himſelfe againſt the Popes decree.
            This office of Patriarchſhip now tranſlated
to Mosko,
               The Patriarches iuriſdiction. beareth a ſuperiour authoritie
ouer all the Churches, not onely of Ruſſia, &amp;
other the Emperours dominions, but thorough
out all the churches of Chriſtendome
that were before vnder the Patriarch of Cō
                  ſtantinople,
or Sio: or at leaſt the Ruſſe Patriarch
imagineth himſelfe to haue the ſame
authoritie. Hee hath vnder him as his proper
dioceſſe the Prouince of Mosko, beſides
other peculiars. His court, or office is
kept at the Mosko.
            
            Before the creatiō of this new Patriarch,The Metropolites.
they had but one Metropolite, that was called
the Metropolite of Mosko. Now for more

ſtate to their Church, and newe Patriarch,
they haue two Metropolites, the one of Nouogrod
velica, the other of Roſtoue. Their
office is to receiue of the Patriarch ſuch Eccleſiaſticall
orders, as he thinketh good, and
to deliuer the charge of them ouer to the
Archbiſhops: beſides the ordering of their
owne dioceſſe.
            Their Archbiſhops are foure: of Smolenſko,
               Archbiſhops.
               Cazon, Vobsko, and Vologda. The partes of
their office is all one with the Metropolits:
ſaue that they haue an vnder iuriſdiction,
as Suffraganes to the Metropolites, and ſuperiours
to the Biſhops. The next are the
Vladikeis,
               Biſhops. or Biſhops, that are but ſixe in
all: of Crutitska, of Rezan, of Otfer and
Torſhock, of Collomenska, of Volodemer, of
Suſdalla. Theſe haue euery one a very large
dioceſſe: as diuiding the reſt of the whole
countrie among them.
            The matters perteyning to the Eccleſiaſticall
iuriſdiction,Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction. of the Metropolites,
Archbiſhops, and Biſhops are the ſame in a
manner that are vſed by the Cleargie in other
partes of Chriſtendome. For beſides
their authoritie ouer the Cleargie, and ordering
ſuch matters as are meare Eccleſiaſticall,
their iuriſdiction extendeth to all teſtamentarie
cauſes, matters of marriage,
and diuorcementes, ſome pleas of iniuries,

&amp;c. To which purpoſe alſo they haue
their Officials, or Commiſſaries (which
they call Boiaren Vladitskey) that are Laymen
of the degree of Dukes,Their Gentlemen cō
                  miſſaries. or Gentlemen,
that keepe their Courtes and execute
their iuriſdiction. Which beſides their other
oppreſsions ouer the common people,
raigne ouer the Prieſtes: as the Dukes
&amp; Diacks doo ouer the poore people, within
their precincts. As for the Archbiſhop or
Biſhop himſelfe, he beareth no ſway in deciding
thoſe cauſes, that are brought into
his Court. But if hee would moderate any
matter, hee muſt doo it by intreatie with
his Gentleman officiall. The reaſon is, becauſe
theſe Boiarskey, or Gentlemen officials,
are not appointed by the Biſhops, but
by the Emperour himſelfe, or his Counſell,
and are to giue account of their doings to
none but to them. If the Biſhoppe can intreat
at his admiſsion to haue the choice of
his owne officiall, it is accounted for a ſpeciall
great fauour. But to ſpeake it as it is,
the Cleargie of Ruſſia, aſwell concerning
their landes and reuenues, as their authoritie
and iuriſdiction, are altogether ordered
and ouer ruled by the Emperour, and his
Counſell, and haue ſo much, and no more of
both as their pleaſure doth permit thē. They
haue alſo their aſsiſtants or ſeuerall Counſels

(as they call them) of certeine Prieſts that
are of their dioceſſe, reſiding within their
cathedrall cities, to the number of foure and
twentie a piece. Theſe aduiſe with them about
the ſpeciall and neceſſarie matters belonging
to their charge.
            Concerning their rentes and reuenues
to mainteyne their dignities,The church reuenues. it is ſomewhat
large. The Patriarches yearely rents out of
his landes (beſides other fees) is about 3000.
rubbels, or markes. The Metropolites and
Archbiſhops about 2500. The Biſhops ſome
a 1000. ſome 800. ſome 500, &amp;c. They haue
had ſome of them (as I haue heard ſay) ten
or twelue thouſand rubbels a yeare: as had
the Metropolite of Nouograde.
            
            Their habite or apparell (when they
ſhewe themſelues in their Pontificalibus after
their ſolemneſt manner) is a miter on
their heades,The habite of their clergy men. after the popiſh faſhion, ſette
with pearle and pretious ſtone, a cope on
their backes, commonly of cloth of golde,
embrodered with pearle, and a Croſiers
ſtaffe in their handes, layed ouer all with
plate of ſiluer double guilt, with a croſſe
or ſheepheardes crooke at the vpper ende
of it. Their ordinarie habite othewiſe
when they ride or goe abroad, is a hood on
their heads of blacke colour, that hangeth
downe their backes, and ſtandeth out like a

bongrace before. Their vpper garment
(which they call Reis) is a gowne or mantell
of blacke Damaske, with many liſtes or
gardes of white Sattin layed vpon it, euerie
garde about two fingers broad, and their
Croſiers ſtaffe carried before them. Themſelues
followe after, bleſsing the people
with their two forefingers, with a marueilous
grace.
            The election,The electiō of Biſhops. and appointing of the Biſhops
and the reſt, perteyneth wholy to the
Emperour himſelfe. They are choſen euer
out of the Monaſteries: ſo that there is no
Biſhop, Archbiſhop, nor Metropolite, but
hath bene a Monke, or Frier before. And
by that reaſon they are, and muſt all bee vnmaried
men, for their vow of chaſtitie when
they were firſt ſhorne. When the Emperour
hath appointed whom hee thinketh good,
he is inueſted in the Cathedrall church of
his dioces, with many ceremonies, much after
the manner of the Popiſh inauguration.
They haue alſo their Deanes, &amp; their Archdeacons.
            As for preaching the worde of God,The learning &amp; exerciſe of the Ruſſe Clergie.
or any teaching, or exhorting ſuch as are
vnder them, they neyther vſe it, nor haue any
skill of it: the whole Cleargie beyng
vtterlie vnlearned bothe for other knowledge,
and in the word of God. Onely their

manner is twiſe euery yeere, vz. the firſt of
September (which is the firſt day of their
yere) and on S. Iohn Baptiſts day, to make an
ordinarie ſpeach to the people, euery Metropolite,
Archbiſhop, and Biſhop in his Cathedrall
Church, to this or like effect: That
if anie be in malice towardes his neighbour,
hee ſhall leaue off his malice: if any haue
thought of treaſon or rebellion againſt his
Prince, he beware of ſuch practiſe: if he haue
not kept his faſts, and vowes, nor done his
other dueties to the holie Church, he ſhal amend
that fault, &amp;c. And this is a matter of
forme with them, vttered in as many words,
and no more, in a manner, then I haue heere
ſet downe. Yet the matter is done with that
grace and ſolemnitie, in a pulpit of purpoſe
ſet vp for this one Acte, as if he were to diſcourſe
at large of the whole ſubſtance of diuinitie.
At the Mosko the Emperour himſelfe
is euer preſent at this ſolemne exhortation.
            As themſelues are voyde of all maner of
learning, ſo are they warie to keepe out all
meanes that might bring any in: as fearing
to haue their ignorance, and vngodlineſſe
diſcouered. To that purpoſe they haue perſwaded
the Emperours, that it would breed
innouation, and ſo danger to their ſtate, to
haue anie noueltie of learning come within

the Realme. Wherein they ſay but trueth, for
that a man of ſpirit and vnderſtāding, helped
by learning and liberal education, can hardly
indure a tyrannicall gouernment. Some
yeres paſt in the other Emperors time, there
came a Preſſe and Letters out of Polonia, to
the citie of Mosko, where a printing houſe
was ſet vp, with great liking &amp; allowance of
the Emperour himſelfe. But not long after,
the houſe was ſet on fire in the night time,
and the preſſe and letters quite burnt vp, as
was thought by the procurement of the
Cleargy men.
            Their Prieſtes (whom they call Papaes are
made by the Biſhops,Prieſts. without any great triall
for worthineſſe of giftes, before they admit
them, or ceremonies in their admiſsion:
ſaue that their heades are ſhorne (not ſhauen
for that they like not) about an hand bredth
or more in the crowne, and that place annoynted
with oyle by the Biſhop: who in
his admiſsion putteth vpon the prieſt, firſt
his ſurpleſſe, and then ſetteth a white croſſe
on his breſt of ſilke, or ſome other matter,
which he is to weare eight dayes, and no
more: and ſo giueth him authoritie to ſay
and ſing in the Church, and to adminiſter
the Sacraments.
            They are men vtterly vnlearned, which is
no marueile, foraſmuch as their makers, the

Biſhops themſelues (as before was ſaide) are
cleere of that qualitie, and make no farther
vſe at al of any kind of learning, no not of the
ſcriptures themſelues, ſaue to reade and to
ſing them. Their ordinary charge &amp; functiō
is to ſay the Leiturgie, to adminiſter the Sacraments
after their maner, to keepe &amp; deck
their idoles, and to doe the other ceremonies
vſuall in their Churches. Their number
is great becauſe their townes are parted into
many ſmal pariſhes, without any deſcretion
for deuiding them into competent numbers
of houſholds, and people for a iuſt congregation:
as the manner in all places where
the meanes is neglected, for increaſing of
knowledge, and inſtruction towardes God.
Which cannot well be had, where by means
of an vnequall partition of the people, and
pariſhes, there followeth a want and vnequalitie
of ſtipend for a ſufficient miniſterie.
            For their prieſts,The Ruſſe Prieſts can marry but once. it is lawful to marrie for
the firſt time. But if the firſt wife dye, a ſecond
hee cannot take, but hee muſt looſe
his Prieſthood, and his liuing withall. The
reaſon they make out of that place of Saint
Paul to Timothie 1. 3. 2. not well vnderſtood
thinking that to bee ſpoken of diuers
wiues ſucceſsiuely, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
of at one and the ſame time. If he will needs

marry againe after his firſt wife is dead, hee
is no longer called Papa, but Roſpapa, or
Prieſt quondam. This maketh the Prieſtes to
make much of their wiues, who are accounted
as the matrones, and of beſt reputation
among the women of the pariſh.
            For the ſtipend of the Prieſt, their manner
is not to pay him any tenthes of corne,
or ought els: but he muſt ſtand at the deuotion
of the people of his pariſh, and make vp
the incommes towards his maintenance, ſo
wel as he can, by offerings, ſhriftes, marriages,
burials, dirges, and prayers for the dead
and the liuing. (which they call Molitua)
Forbeſides their publike ſeruice within their
Churches, their manner is for euery priuate
man to haue a prayer ſaide for him by the
Prieſt, vpon any occaſion of buſineſſe whatſoeuer,
whether he ride, goe, ſaile, plough,
or whatſoeuer els he doeth. Which is not
framed according to the occaſion of his buſineſſe,
but at randome, being ſome of their
ordinarie and vſuall Church-prayers. And
this is thought to be more holy, and effectuall,
if it be repeated by the Prieſts mouth, rather
then by his owne. They haue a cuſtome
beſides to ſolemnize the Saints day, that is
patrone to their Church once euery yeere.
What time al their neighbours of their coū
               trey,
and pariſhes about, come in to haue

prayers ſaide to that Saint for themſelues,
and their friendes: and ſo make an offering
to the Prieſt for his paines. This offering
may yeeld them ſome ten poundes a yeere,
more or leſſe, as the patrone, or Saint of
that Church is of credite, and eſtimation among
them. The manner is on this day
(which they keep anniuerſarie) for the prieſt,
to hire diuers of his neighbour prieſtes to
helpe him: as hauing more diſhes to dreſſe
for the Saint, then he can wel turne his hand
vnto. They vſe beſides to viſite their pariſhioners
houſes, with holy water, and perfume,
commonly once a quarter: and ſo hauing
ſprinckled, and beſenſed the goodman and
his wife with the reſt of their houſhold, and
houſhold-ſtuffe, they receiue ſome deuotion
more or leſſe,The prieſts maintenance. as the man is of abilitie. This
and the reſt laid altogether, may make vp
for the prieſt towardes his maintenaunce, about
thirtie or fourtie rubbels a yere: wherof
he payeth the tenth part to the Biſhop of
the Dioces.
            The Papa or Prieſt is knowen by his long
tufts of haire,The prieſts attire. hanging downe by his eares,
his gowne with a broad cape, and a walking
ſtaffe in his hand. For the reſt of his habite,
he is apparelled like the common ſort. When
he ſaith the Leiturgie or ſeruice, within the
Church, he hath on him his ſurpleſſe, and

ſometimes his coape, if the day be more ſolemne.
They haue beſides their Papaes or
Prieſtes, their Churnapapaes (as they call
them) that is; Blacke Priestes: that may
keepe their Benefices, though they bee admitted
Friers withall within ſome Monaſterie.
They ſeeme to bee the verie ſame
that were called Regular Prieſtes in the Popiſh
Church. Vnder the Prieſt, is a Deacon
in euery Church, that doeth nothing but the
office of a pariſh Clearke. As for their Protopapaes,
or Archeprieſtes, and their Archdeacons
(that are next in election to be their
Protopopas) they ſerue onely in the cathedral
Churches.
            Of Friers they haue an infinit rabble farre
greater thē in any other countrey,Friers. where popery
is profeſſed. Euery city, &amp; good part of
the countrey, ſwarmeth ful of them. For they
haue wrought (as the popiſh Friers did by
their ſuperſtition and hypocriſie) that if any
part of the Realme bee better and ſweeter
then other, there ſtandeth a Friery, or a monaſtery
dedicated to ſome Saint.
            The number of them is ſomuch the greater,
not onely for that it is augmented by
the ſuperſtition of the countrey, but becauſe
the Fryers life is the ſafeſt from the
oppreſsions, and exactions, that fall vpon
the Commons. Which cauſeth many to

put on the Fryers weede, as the beſt armour
to beare off ſuch blowes. Beſides ſuch
as are voluntarie, there are diuers that are
forced to ſhire themſelues Fryers, vpon
ſome diſpleaſure. Theſe are for the moſt part
of the chiefe Nobility. Diuers take the Monaſteries
as a place of Sanctuary, and there
become Friers, to auoyde ſome puniſhment,
that they had deſerued by the lawes of the
Realme. For if hee gette a Monaſtery ouer
his head, and there put on a coole before
hee be attached, it is a protection to him
for euer againſt any law, for what crime ſoeuer:
except it be for treaſon. But this Prouiſo
goeth withal, that no man commeth there,
(except ſuch as are commanded by the Emperour
to be receiued) but hee giueth them
lands, or bringeth his ſtock with him, &amp; putteth
it into the common Treaſurie. Some
bring a 1000 rubbels, &amp; ſome more. None is
admitted vnder 3. or 4. hundred.
            The manner of their admiſsion is after
this ſort.Their maner of ſhiring Friers. Firſt, the Abbot ſtrippeth him of
all his ſecular or ordinarie apparell. Then
hee putteth vpon him next to his skinne, a
white flannel ſhirt, with a long garment ouer
it down to the ground, girded vnto him
with a broade leather belt. His vppermoſt
garment is a weede of Garras, or Say, for colour
and faſhion, much like to the vpper

weed of a Chimney-ſweeper. Then is his
crown ſhorne a hand breadth, or more cloſe
to the very skinne, and theſe, or like wordes
pronounced by the Abbot, whiles hee clippeth
his haire: As theſe haires are clipped of, &amp;
taken from thy head: ſo now we take thee, and ſeparate
thee cleane from the worlde, and worldly
thinges, &amp;c. This done, hee annoynteth his
crowne with oyle, and putteth on his coole:
and ſo taketh him in among the Fraternitie.
They vowe perpetuall chaſtitie, and abſtinence
from fleſh.
            Beſides their landes, (that are verie great)
they are the greateſt marchants in the whole
countrey, and deale for all manner of commodities.
Some of their monaſteries diſpēd
in landes, one thouſande, or two thouſande
rubbels a yeere. There is one Abbey called
Troits, that hath in lands &amp; fees, the ſumme
of 100000. rubbels, or marks a yeere. It is
built in maner of a Caſtle, walled rounde about,
with great ordinance planted on the
wall, and conteineth within it a large bredth
of grounde, and great varietie of building.
There are of Friers within it, (beſides their
officers, and other ſeruants) about 700. The
Empreſſe that now is, hath many vowes to
Saint Sergius, that is patrone there: to intreat
him to make her fruitful, as hauing no children
by the Emperour her huſband. Lightly

euery yeere ſhe goeth on pilgrimage to him
from the Mosko, on foote, about 80 Engliſh
miles, with fiue or ſixe thouſand women attending
vpon her, all in blewe liueries, and
foure thouſand ſouldiers for her garde. But
Saint Sergius hath not yet heard her prayers,
though (they ſay) he hath a ſpeciall gift and
facultie that way.
            What learning there is among their Fryers,The Friers learning.
may be knowen by their Biſhops, that
are the choyce men out of all their monaſteries.
I talked with one of them at the Citie
of Vologda, where (to trie his skill) I offered
him a Ruſſe Teſtament, and turned him
to the firſt Chapter of Saint Mathewes Goſpel.
Where hee beganne to reade in verie
good order. I asked him firſt what part of
ſcripture it was, that hee had read? hee anſwered,
that hee coulde not well tell. Howe
manie Euangeliſtes there were in the newe
Teſtament? Hee ſayde he knew not. Howe
manie Apoſtles there were? Hee thought
there were twelue. Howe he ſhoulde be ſaued?
Whereunto he anſweared mee with a
piece of Ruſſe doctrine, that hee knew not
whether he ſhoulde bee ſaued, or no: but if
God woulde Poſhallouate him, or gratifie
him ſo much, as to ſaue him, ſo it was, hee
would be glad of it: if not, what remedie.
I asked him, why he ſhoare himſelfe a Fryer?

He anſwered, becauſe he would eat his bread
with peace. This is the learning of the Friers
of Ruſſia, which though it be not to bee
meaſured by one, yet partly it may bee geſſed
by the ignorance of this man, what is in
the reſt.
            They haue alſo many Nunneries,Nunneries. whereof
ſome may admitte none but Noblemens
widowes, and daughters, when the Emperour
meaneth to keepe them vnmarried,
from continuing the blood or ſtocke, which
he would haue extinguiſhed. To ſpeak of the
life of their Friers, and Nunnes, it needes not,
to thoſe that know the hypocriſie, and vncleanneſſe
of that Cloyſter-broode. The
Ruſſe himſelfe (though otherwiſe addicted
to all ſuperſtition) ſpeaketh ſo fowlly of it,
that it muſt needes gaine ſilence of any modeſt
man.
            Beſides theſe,Eremites. they haue certeyne Eremites,
(whome they call Holy men) that are
like to thoſe Gymnoſophiſts, for their life and
behauiour: though farre vnlike for their
knowledge, &amp; learning. They vſe to go ſtarke
naked, ſaue a clout about their middle, with
their haire hanging long, and wildely about
their ſhoulders, and many of them with an
iron coller, or chaine about their neckes, or
middes, euen in the very extremity of winter.
Theſe they take as Prophets, and men of

great holines, giuing them a liberty to ſpeak
what they liſt, without any cōtroulmēt, thogh
it be of thee very higheſt himſelfe. So that if
he reproue any openly, in what ſort ſoeuer,
they anſwere nothing, but that it is Po gracum,
that is, for their ſinnes. And if anie of
them take ſome piece of ſale ware from anie
mans ſhop, as he paſſeth by, to giue where he
liſt, hee thinketh himſelfe much beloued of
God, and much beholding to the holy man,
for taking it in that ſort.
            Of this kinde there are not many, becauſe
it is a very harde and colde profeſsion,
to goe naked in Ruſſia, ſpecially in Winter.
Among other at this time, they haue one
at Mosko, that walketh naked about the
ſtreetes, and inueyeth commonly againſt
the ſtate, and gouernment, eſpecially againſt
the Godonoes, that are thought at this time
to bee great oppreſſours of that Common
wealth. An other there was, that dyed not
many yeeres agoe (whome they called Baſileo)
that would take vpon him to reprooue
the olde Emperour,Baſileo the Eremite▪
                for all his crueltie, and
oppreſsions, done towards his people. His
body they haue trāſlated of late into a ſumptuous
Church, neere the Emperours houſe in
Mosko, and haue canonized him for a Saint.
Many miracles he doth there (for ſo the Friers
make the people to beleeue) and manie

offrings are made vnto him, not only by the
people, but by the chiefe Nobilitie, and the
Emperour, and Empreſſe themſelues, which
viſite that Church with great deuotion. But
this laſt yeere, at my beeing at Mosko, this
Saint had ill lucke, in working his miracles.
For a lame man that had his limmes reſtored
(as it was pretended by him) was charged
by a woman that was familiar with him
(being then fallen out) that hee halted but
in the day time, and coulde leape merily
when he came home at night. And that hee
had intended this matter ſixe yeeres before.
Nowe he is put into a Monaſtery, and
there rayleth vpon the Fryers, that hyred
him to haue this counterfaite miracle, practiſed
vpon him. Beſides this diſgrace, a litle
before my comming from thence, there
were eyght ſlaine within his Church by fire
in a thunder. Which cauſed his belles (that
were tingling before all day and night long
as in triumph of the miracles wrought by
Baſileo their Saint) to ring ſomewhat ſoftlier,
and hath wrought no little diſcredite to
this Miracle-worker. There was another of
great account at Plesko,
               Nicôla the Eremite. (called Nichôla of
Plesko) that did much good, when this Emperours
father came to ſack the towne, vpon
ſuſpition of their reuolting and rebellion againſt
him. The Emperour, after hee had ſaluted

the Eremite, at his lodging, ſent him a
reward. And the Holy man to requite the
Emperour, ſent him a piece of rawe fleſhe,
beyng then their Lent time. Which the Emperour
ſeeing, bid one to tell him, that hee
marueiled that the Holy man woulde offer
him fleſh to eat in the Lent, when it was forbidden,
by order of holie Church. And doth
Euasko, (which is as much to ſaye, as Iacke)
thinke (quoth Nicôla) that it is vnlawfull to
eate a piece of beaſts fleſh in Lent, and not to
eate vp ſo much mans fleſh, as hee hath done
already. So threatning the Emperour with
a prophecy of ſome hard aduenture to come
vpon him, except hee left murdering of his
people, and departed the towne: he ſaued a
great many mens liues at that time.
            This maketh the people to like very well
of them, becauſe they are as Paſquils, to note
their great mens faults, that no man els dare
ſpeake of. Yet it falleth out ſometime, that
for this rude libertie, which they take vpon
them, after a counterfeite maner, by imitation
of Prophets, they are made away in ſecret:
as was one or two of them, in the
laſt Emperours time, for beyng ouer
bolde in ſpeaking againſt
his gouernment.
         
         
            
            Of their Leiturgie, or forme of
Church-ſeruice, and their manner of
adminiſtring the Sacraments.
            The 22. Chapter.
            
               THeir morning ſeruice they
call Zautrana,
               Their morning Seruice. that is, mattins.
It is done in this order.
The Prieſt entereth into the
Church, with his Deacon following
him. And when hee
is come to the middle of the Church, he beginneth
to ſay with a loude voyce: Blasſlauey
Vladika (that is) Bleſſe vs heauenly Paſtor:
meaning of Chriſt. Then he addeth, In
the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of
the holy Ghoſt, one very God in Trinitie: and Aſpody
Pomeluy, or, Lorde haue mercy vpon vs,
Lorde haue mercie vpon vs, Lorde haue mercie
vpon vs: repeated three times. This done,
hee marcheth on towardes the Chauncell, or
Sanctum Sanctorum, (as they vſe to call it)
and ſo entreth into the Scharſuey Dwere, or
the heauenly doore: which no man may enter
into, but the Prieſt only. Where ſtanding
at the altar, or table (ſet neere to the vpper
wall of the chauncell) hee ſayeth the Lordes
prayer, and then againe Aſpody Pomeluy,
               
or Lord haue mercie vpon vs, Lorde haue mercie
vpon vs, &amp;c: pronounced twelue times.
Then prayſed be the Trinitie, the Father, the
Sonne and holie Ghoſt, for euer and euer. Wherto
the Deacons, and people ſay, Amen. Next
after, the Prieſt addeth the Pſalmes for that
day, and beginneth with O come let vs worſhippe,
and fall downe before the Lorde, &amp;c. and
therewithall himſelfe, with the Deacons, &amp;
people, all turne themſelues towardes their
Idoles, or Images, that hang on the wall and
croſsing themſelues, bowe downe three
times, knocking their heades to the verie
ground After this, he readeth the ten commandements,
and Athanaſius Creed, out of
the Seruice booke.
            This being done, the Deacon that ſtandeth
without the heauenly doore, or chauncel,
readeth a piece of a Legēd, out of a written
booke, (for they haue it not in print) of
ſome Saints life, miracles, &amp;c. This is diuided
into manie partes, for euerie day in the
yeere, and is read by them with a playne
ſinging note, not vnlike to the Popiſh tune,
when they ſoung their Goſpels. After all
this (which reacheth to an houre, and an
halfe, or two houres of length) hee addeth
certeyne ſette Collectes, or prayers vpon
that which hee hath read out of the Legend
before: and ſo endeth his Seruice.

All this while ſtand burning before their Idoles,
a great many of waxe candles, (wherof
ſome are of the bigneſſe of a mans waſt)
vowed, or enioyned by penance, vpon the
people of the pariſh.
            About 9. of the clock in the morning, they
haue an other ſeruice, called Obeidna, (or
Compline) much after the order of the Popiſh
Seruice, that bare that name. If it bee
ſome high, or Feſtiuall day, they furniſh
their Seruice beſide, with Bleſſed bee the
Lorde God of Iſrael, &amp;c. and We prayſe thee O
God, &amp;c: Sung with a more ſolemne, and curious
note.
            Their Euening ſeruice,Their Euening ſeruice. is called Vecherna,
where the Prieſt beginneth with Blaſlauey
Vladika, as hee did in the morning, and
with the Pſalmes appointed for the Vecherna.
Which beyng read, hee ſingeth, My ſoule
doeth magnifie the Lorde, &amp;c. And then the
Prieſt, Deacons, and people, all with one
voice, ſing, Aſpody pomelui, or Lord haue mercie
vpon vs, thirty times together. Whereunto
the boyes that are in the Church, anſwere
all with one voyce, rowling it vp ſo faſt, as
their lippes can goe: Verij, Verij, Verij, Verij,
or, Prayſe, Prayſe, Prayſe, &amp;c. thirty times together,
with a very ſtraunge noyſe. Then is
read by the prieſt, &amp; vpō the holidaies ſung,
the firſt Pſalme: Bleſſed is the man, &amp;c. And in

the end of it, is added Alleluia repeated ten
times. The next in order is ſome part of the
goſpell read by the Prieſt, which hee endeth
with Alleluia repeated three times. And ſo
hauing ſaid a collect in remembrance of the
Saint of that day, he endeth his euening ſeruice.
All this while the Prieſt ſtandeth aboue
at the altar or high table, within the Chancel,
or Sanctum Sanctorum, whence he neuer moueth
al the ſeruice time. The Deacon, or Deacons
(which are many in their cathedrall
Churches) ſtand without the chancell by the
Scharſuey dwere, or heauenly doore: for within
they may not be ſeene all the ſeruice time,
though otherwiſe their office is to ſweepe,
and keepe it, and to ſet vp the waxe candels
before their Idols. The people ſtand together
the whole ſeruice time in the body of
the Church, and ſome in the church porch▪
for piew, or ſeate they haue none within
their churches.
            The Sacrament of baptiſme they adminiſter
after this manner.The manner of the Ruſſe baptiſme. The child is brought
vnto the Church (&amp; this is done within eight
daies after it is borne) if it bee the childe of
ſome Nobleman, it is brought with great
pomp in a rich ſled or wagō, with chaires &amp;
cuſhiōs of cloth of gold, &amp; ſuch like ſumptuous
ſhew of their beſt furniture. When they
are come to the Church, the Prieſt ſtandeth

ready to receiue the child within the church
porch, with his tub of water by him. And thē
beginneth to declare vnto them, that they
haue brought a little Infidell to be made a
Chriſtian, &amp;c. This ended, he teacheth the
witneſſes (that are two or three) in a certeine
ſet forme out of his booke, what their
dutie is in bringing vp the childe after hee is
baptiſed vz. That he muſt be taught to know
God, and Chriſt the Sauiour. And becauſe
God is of great maieſtie, and wee muſt not
preſume to come vnto him without mediatours
(as the manner is when wee make any
ſuit to an Emperour, or great Prince) therefore
they muſt teach him what Saints are
the beſt, &amp; chiefe mediatours, &amp;c. This done,
he cōmandeth the diuell in the name of God
after a coniuring manner, to come out of the
water: &amp; ſo after certeine praiers he plungeth
the childe thriſe ouer head, &amp; eares. For this
they holde to be a point neceſſary, that no
part of the childe be vndipped in the water.
            The words that beare with thē the forme
of baptiſme vttered by the Prieſt, when he
dippeth in the childe, are the very ſame that
are preſcribed in the goſpell, &amp; vſed by vs,
vz: In the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, &amp;
of the Ghoſt. For that they ſhould altar the
forme of the words, and ſay by the holy Ghoſt,
(as I haue heard that they did (folowing certein

heretikes of the Greeke church, I found
to be vntrue, aſwell by report of them that
haue bin often at their baptiſmes, as by their
booke of Leiturgie it ſelfe, wherein the order
of baptiſme is preciſely ſet downe.
            When the childe is baptiſzed, the Prieſt
laieth oile and ſalt tempred together vpon
the forehead, and both ſides of his face, and
then vppon his mouth, drawing it along
with his finger ouer the childes lippes (as
did the Popiſh prieſtes) ſaying withall certeine
prayers to this effect: that God will
make him a good Chriſtian, &amp;c: all this is
done in the Church porch. Then is the
childe (as being now made a Chriſtian, and
meet to be receiued within the church dore)
carried into the church, the Prieſt going before,
and there he is preſented to the chiefe
Idoll of the Church, being layd on a cuſhion
before the feete of the image, by it (as by the
mediatour) to bee commended vnto God.
If the child be fick, or weake (ſpecially in the
winter) they vſe to make the water luke
warme. After baptiſme the manner is to cut
of the haire from the childes head, and hauing
wrapped it within a piece of wax to lay
it vp, as a relique, or monument in a ſecret
place of the church.
            This is the māner of their baptiſme, which
they accoūt to be the beſt &amp; perfecteſt form.

As they doo all other parts of their religion,
receiued (as they ſay) by tradition from the
beſt church▪ meaning the Greeke. And therfore
they will take great paynes to make a
proſelite, or cōuert, either of an infidell, or of
a forrein Chriſtian, by rebaptizing him after
the Ruſſe manner. When they take any Tartar
priſoner, commonly they will offer him
life, with condition to be baptized. And yet
they perſwade very few of them to redeeme
their life ſo: becauſe of the naturall hatred
the Tartar beareth to the Ruſſe, and the opinion
he hath of his falſhood, and iniuſtice.
The yere after Mosko was fired by the Chrim
Tartar, there was taken a Diuoymorſey, one
of the chiefe in that exploit with 300. Tartars
more: who had all their liues offered
thē, if they would be baptized after the Ruſſe
manner. Which they refuſed all to doo, with
many reproches againſt thoſe that perſwaded
them. And ſo beyng carried to the riuer
Mosko (that runneth through the citie) they
were all baptized after a violent manner: being
thruſt downe with a knock on the head
into the water, through an hole made in the
yſe for that purpoſe.Rebaptizing. Of Lieflanders that are
captiues, there are many that take on thē this
ſecōd Ruſſe, baptiſme to get more libertie, &amp;
ſomwhat beſides towards their liuing, which
the Emperour ordinarily vſeth to giue them.
            
               
Of Engliſhmen ſince they frequented the
countrie there was neuer any found, that ſo
much forgot God, his faith, and countrie, as
that he would bee content to be baptized
Ruſſe, for any reſpect of feare, preferment,
or other meanes whatſoeuer: ſaue onely Richard
Relph, that following before an vngodly
trade, by keeping a Caback (againſt the order
of the countrie) and being put of from
that trade, &amp; ſpoiled by the Emperours officers
of that which he had, entred himſelf this
laſt yeare into the Ruſſe profeſsion: &amp; ſo was
rebaptiſed, liuing now aſmuch an idolater, as
before he was a rioter, and vnthrifty perſon.
            Such as thus receiue the Ruſſe baptiſme,
are firſt carried into ſome Monaſterie to be
inſtructed there in the doctrine and ceremonies
of the church. Where they vſe theſe ceremonies.
Firſt, they put him into a new and
freſh ſuite of apparell, made after the Ruſſe
faſhion, and ſet a coronet or (in Sommer) a
garland vpon his head. Then they annoint
his head with oile, &amp; put a waxe candle light
into his hand: and ſo pray ouer him foure
times a day, the ſpace of ſeuen daies. All this
while he is to abſtaine from fleſh and white
meats. The ſeuen daies being ended, he is purified
and waſhed in a bathſtoue, and ſo the
eight day hee is brought into the church,
where he is taught by the Friers how to behaue

himſelfe in preſence of their idols, by
ducking downe, knocking of the head, croſſing
himſelf, and ſuch like geſtures, which are
the greateſt part of the Ruſſe religion.
            The ſacrament of the Lordes ſupper they
receiue but once a yeare,The adminiſtring of the Lords ſupper. in their great Lent
time, a litle before Eaſter. Three at the moſt
are admitted at one time, and neuer aboue.
The manner of their cōmunicating, is thus.
Firſt they cōfeſſe themſelues of all their ſins
to the Prieſt (whō they call their ghoſtly father.
Then they come to the Church, &amp; are
called vp to the Cōmunion table, that ſtandeth
like an altar, a little remoued frō the vpper
end of the Church, after the Doutch maner.
Here firſt they are asked of the Prieſt
whither they be cleane or no, that is, whither
they haue neuer a ſinne behind that
they left vnconfeſſed. If they anſwere, No,
they are taken to the table. Where the Prieſt
beginneth with certeine vſuall prayers, the
communicants ſtanding in the meane while
with their armes foulded one within an other,
like penitentiaries, or mourners. When
theſe prayers are ended, the Prieſt taketh a
ſpoone, and filleth it full of claret wine Then
he putteth into it a ſmall piece of bread, and
tempereth them both together: and ſo deliuereth
them in the ſpoone to the Communicants,
that ſtande in order, ſpeaking the

vſuall wordes of the Sacrament. Eat this &amp;c.
Drinke this &amp;c. both at one time without any
pauſe.
            After that he deliuereth them againe
bread by it ſelf, and then wine carded together
with a little warme water, to repreſent
bloud more rightly (as they thinke) and the
water withall, that flowed out of the ſide of
Chriſt. Whiles this is in doing the communicants
vnfold their armes. And then foulding
them againe, follow the Prieſt thriſe
round about the communion table, and ſo
returne to their places againe. Where hauing
ſaid certeine other prayers, he diſmiſſeth
the communicants, with charge to bee
meary, and to cheere vp themſelues for the
ſeuen daies next following. Which being ended,
he enioyneth them to faſt for it as long
time after. Which they vſe to obſerue with
very great deuotion, eating nothing els but
bread and ſalt, except a little cabbage, and
ſome other hearbe or roote, with water or
quaſſe mead for their drinke.
            This is their manner of adminiſtring the
Sacraments. Wherein what they differ from
the inſtitution of Chriſt, and what ceremonies
they haue added of their owne, or rather
borrowed of the Greekes, may eaſily
be noted.

Firſt,1. Their diſallowing of certeine parts of the Canonicall ſcriptures. concerning the word of
God it ſelf, they will not read
publiquely certeine bookes
of the Canonicall ſcripture,
as the bookes of Moſes: ſpecially the foure
laſt, Exodus, Leuiticus, Numeri, and Deuteronomie,
which they ſay are al made diſauthentique,
and put out of vſe by the comming of
Chriſt: as not able to diſcerne the difference
betwixt the morall, and the ceremoniall law,
The bookes of the prophets they allow of,
but read thē not publikely in their churches
for the ſame reaſon: becauſe they were but
directers vnto Chriſt, &amp; proper (as they ſay)
to the nation of the Iewes. Onely the booke
of Pſalmes they haue in great eſtimation and
ſing and ſay them dayly in their Churches,
Of the new Teſtament they allow, and read
all except the Reuelation: which therefore
they read not (though they allow it becauſe
they vnderſtand it not, neither haue the like
occaſion, to know the fulfilling of the prophecies

conteyned within it, concerning eſpecially
the apoſtaſie of the Antichriſtian
Church, as haue the Weſterne Churches.
Notwithſtanding they haue had their Antichriſts
of the Greeke Church, and may finde
their owne falling of, and the puniſhments
for it by the Turkiſh inuaſion in the prophecies
of that Booke.
            Secondly (which is the fountain of the reſt
of al their corruptiōs,2. Traditions equall to the holy Scripture. both in doctrine &amp; ceremonies)
they holde with the Papiſtes, that
their church Traditions are of equall authoritie
with the written worde of God. Wherein
they prefer thēſelues before other churches:
affirming that they haue the true and right
traditions deliuered by the Apoſtles to the
Greeke church, and ſo vnto them.
            3. That the church (meaning the Greeke
and ſpecially the Patriarch and his Synod,3. The Church to haue ſoueraigne authoritie in interpreting the Scriptures. as
the head of the reſt) haue a ſoueraigne authoritie
to interpret the Scriptures, and that
all are bound to holde that interpretation as
ſound, and authentique.
            4. Concerning the diuine nature &amp; the
three perſons,4. The holy Ghoſt to proceed frō the Father onely. in the one ſubſtance of God,
that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the
Father onely, and not from the Sonne.
            5. About the office of Chriſt,5. Chriſt not ſole mediator of interceſſiō. they holde
many fowle errours, and the ſame almoſt as
doth the Popiſh church: namely that hee is

the ſole mediatour of redemption, but not of
interceſsion. Their chiefe reaſon (if they bee
talked withall) for defence of this errour, is
that vnapt and fooliſh compariſon, betwixt
God and a Monarch or Prince of this world,
that muſt bee ſued vnto by Mediatours about
him: wherein they giue ſpeciall preferment
to ſome aboue others, as to the bleſſed
Virgin whom they call Precheſte, or vndefiled,
and S. Nicôlas, whom they call Scora pomoſnick,
or the Speedy helper, and ſay that he
hath 300. angels of the chiefeſt appointed by
God to attend vpon him. This hath brought
them to an horrible exceſſe of idolatry, after
the groſſeſt &amp; prophaneſt māner, giuing vnto
their images al religious worſhip of praier,
thankſgiuing, offerings, &amp; adoration, with
proſtrating and knocking their heads to the
ground before thē, as to God himſelf. Which
becauſe they doo to the picture, not to the
portraiture of the Saint, they ſay they worſhip
not an idol, but the Saint in his image &amp;
ſo offend not God: forgetting the cōmandement
of God, that forbiddeth to make the
image or likenes of any thing, for any religious
worſhip, or vſe whatſoeuer. Their church
walles are very full of them, richly hanged &amp;
ſet forth with pearle &amp; ſtone vpō the ſmooth
table. Though ſome alſo they haue emboſſed,
that ſtick from the board almoſt an inch outwards.

They call them Chudouodites, or their
miracle workers: and when they prouide
them to ſet vp in their Churches, in no caſe
they may ſay that they haue bought the image,
but exchaunged monie for it.
            6. For the means of iuſtification,6. Iuſtification by workes. they agree
with the Papiſts, that it is not by faith
only apprehēding Chriſt, but by their works
alſo. And that Opus operatum, or the worke
for the worke ſake, muſt needes pleaſe God.
And therefore they are all in their numbers
of praiers, faſtes, vowes, &amp; offrings to ſaints,
almes deeds, croſsings &amp; ſuch like, and carrie
their numbring beads about with them cō
               tinually,
aſwel the Emperour &amp; his Nobilitie
as the cōmon people, not only in the church,
but in all other publike places, ſpecially at any
ſet or ſolemne meeting, as in their faſtes,
lawe courts, common conſultations, intertainement
of Ambaſſadours, and ſuch like.
            7. They ſay with the Papiſts that no man
can be aſſured of his ſaluation,7. Saluation vncerteine. til the laſt ſentence
be paſſed at the day of iudgement.
            8. They vſe auricular confeſsion,8. Auricular confeſſion. &amp; thinke
that they are purged by the very action frō
ſo many ſinnes, as they confeſſe by name, and
in particular to the Prieſt.
            9. They hold three ſacramentes, of Baptiſme,
               9. Three Sacramēts.
the Lords ſupper, and the laſt annoiling,
or vnction. Yet concerning their Sacrament

of extreame vnction, they holde it not ſo
neceſſarie to ſaluation as they do baptiſme,
but thinke it a great curſe and puniſhment of
God,10. All dā
                  ned that die without baptiſme. if any die with out it.
            10. They thinke there is a neceſsitie of
baptiſme, and that all are condemned that
die without it.11. Anabaptiſme.
            
            11. They rebaptiſe as many Chriſtians
(not being of the Greek church) as they conuert
to their Ruſſe profeſsion: becauſe they
are diuided from the true Church, which is
the Greeke,12. Difference of meates. as they ſay.
            12. They make a difference of meates &amp;
drinks, accounting the vſe of one, to be more
holy then of an other. And therefore in their
ſet faſtes they forbeare to eate fleſhe, and
white meats (as we call them) after the manner
of the Popiſh ſuperſtition: which they
obſerue ſo ſtrictly, &amp; with ſuch blinde deuotion,
as that they will rather die, then eat one
bit of fleſh, egges, or ſuch like, for the health
of their bodies in their extreme ſickneſe.
            13. They hold marriage to be vnlawfull
for all the Clergie men,13. Marriage for ſome perſons vnlawfull. except the prieſts only,
and for them alſo after the firſt wife, as
was ſaid before. Neither doo they well allow
of it in Lay men after the ſecond marriage.
Which is a pretence now vſed againſt the
Emperours only brother, a child of ſix yeres
old: Who therefore is not praiſed for in their

churches (as their manner is otherwiſe for
the Princes bloud) becauſe hee was borne of
the ſixt marriage, and ſo not legitimate This
charge was giuen to the prieſts by the Emperour
himſelfe, by procurement of the
Godonoes: who make him beleeue that it is a
good pollicie to turne away the liking of the
people from the next ſucceſſour.
            Many other falſe opinions they haue in
matter of religion. But theſe are the chiefe,
which they holde partly by meanes of their
traditions (which they haue receiued from
the Greeke church) but ſpecially by ignorance
of the holy Scriptures. Which notwithſtanding
they haue in the Polonian tongue,
(that is all one with theirs ſome few wordes
excepted) yet fewe of them read them with
that godly care which they ought to doo:
neither haue they (if they would) bookes ſufficient
of the old and new Teſtament for the
common people, but of their Leiturgie onely,
or booke of common ſeruice, whereof
there are great numbers.
            All this miſchief commeth from the clergie,
who being ignorant and godleſſe themſelues,
are very warie to keepe the people
likewiſe in their ignorance and blindneſſe,
for their liuing and bellies ſake: partly alſo
frō the manner of gouernment ſetled among
them: which the Emperours (whom it ſpecially

behoueth) liſt not to haue chaunged by
any innouation, but to retaine that religion
that beſt agreeth with it. Which notwithſtanding
it is not to be doubted, but that hauing
the word of God in ſome ſort (though without
the ordinarie meanes to attaine to a true
ſenſe and vnderſtanding of it) God hath alſo
his number among them. As may partly
appeare by that which a Ruſſe at Mosko ſaid
in ſecret to one of my ſeruaunts, ſpeaking againſt
their images and other ſuperſtitions:
That God had giuen vnto England light to
day, and might giue it to morrow (if he pleaſed)
to them.
            As for any inquiſition or proceeding againſt
men for matter of religion, I could
heare of none: ſaue a few yeares ſince againſt
one man and his wife, who were kept in a
cloſe priſon the ſpace of 28. yeares, till they
were ouer growen into a deformed faſhion,
for their hayre, nailes, collour of countenance,
and ſuch like, and in the end were burned
at Mosko, in a ſmall houſe ſet on fire.
The cauſe was kepte ſecrete, but like it was
for ſome part of truth in matter of religion:
though the people were made to beleeue
by the Prieſts and Friers, that they
held ſome great, and damnable
hereſie.
         
         
            
            Of the manner of ſolemnizing
their Marriages.
            The 24. Chapter.
            
               THe manner of making &amp; ſolemnizing
their marriages is different
frō the maner of other countries.
The man (though he neuer
ſaw the woman before) is not permitted
to haue any ſight of hir al the time of his woing:
which he doth not by himſelf, but by his
mother or ſome other ancient woman of his
kin, or acquaintance. When the liking is taken
(aſwell by the parents as by the parties
thēſelues, for without the knowledge &amp; conſent
of the parents, the cōtract is not lawful)
the fathers on both ſides, or ſuch as are to thē
in ſteede of fathers, with their other chiefe
friends, haue a meeting &amp; conference about
the dowrie, which is comonly very large after
the abilitie of the parents: ſo that you ſhal
haue a market man (as they call them) giue a
1000. rubbels, or more with his daughter.
            As for the man it is neuer required of him,The manner of indowment for wiues.
nor ſtādeth with their cuſtome to make any
iointer in recompence of the dowrie. But in
caſe he haue a child by his wife, ſhe enioieth a
thirde deale after his diſeaſe. If hee haue
two children by hir or more, ſhee is to haue

a courteſie more, at the diſcretion of the huſband.
If the huſband depart without iſſue
by his wife, ſhee is returned home to hir
friends without any thing at al, ſaue only hir
dowrie: if the huſband leaue ſo much behind
him in goods When the agreement is made
cōcerning the dowrie, they ſigne bonds one
to the other, aſwell for the paiment of the
dowrie as the performing of the mariage by
a certein day. If the woman were neuer married
before, hir father and friends are bound
beſides to aſſure hir a maiden. Which breedeth
many brabbels and quarrels at Law, if
the man take any conceipt concerning the
behauiour, and honeſtie of his wife.
            Thus the contract being made, the parties
begin to ſend tokēs the one to the other, the
woman firſt, then afterwards the mā, but yet
ſee not one an other till the marriage be ſolemnized.
On the eaue before the marriage
day, the bride is carried in a Collimago, or
coach, or in a ſledde (if it be winter) to the
bridegromes houſe, with hir marriage apparell
and bedſtead with hir, which they are to
lie in. For this is euer prouided by the Bride,
and is commonly very faire, with much coſt
beſtowed vpon it. Here ſhe is accompaned
all that night by hir mother, and other women:
but not welcommed, nor once ſeene by
the Bridegrome himſelfe.
            
               
When the time is come to haue the marriage
ſolemnized,Ceremonies in mariages. the Bride hath put vpon
her a kind of hood, made of fine knitworke,
or lawne, that couereth her head, and all her
body downe to the middle. And ſo accompanied
with her friends, &amp; the bridegroome
with his, they goe to Church all on horſebacke,
though the Church bee neere hande,
and themſelues but of very meane degree,
The wordes of contract, and other ceremonies
in ſolemnizing the marriage, are much
after the order, and with the ſame wordes
that are vſed with vs: with a ring alſo giuen
to the Bride. Which beeing put on, and the
wordes of contract pronounced: the Brides
hand is deliuered into the hand of the Bride
groome, which ſtandeth al this while on the
one ſide of the altar or table, and the Bride
on the other. So the marriage knot beeing
knitte by the Prieſt, the Bride commeth to
the Bridegroome (ſtanding at the end of the
altar or table) and falleth downe at the feete,
knocking her head vpon his ſhooe, in token
of her ſubiection, and obedience. And
the Bridegroome againe caſteth the lappe
of his gowne, or vpper garment, ouer the
Bride, in token of his duetie to protect, and
cheriſh her.
            Then the Bridegroome, and Bride, ſtanding
both together at the tables ende, commeth

firſt the father, and the other friends of
the Bride, and bowe themſelues downe low
to the Bridegroome: and ſo likewiſe his
friends bow themselues to the Bride, in tokē
of affinity &amp; loue, euer after betwixt the two
kinreds. And withall, the father of the Bridegroome
offreth to the prieſt, a loafe of bread,
who deliuereth it ſtraight again to the father,
&amp; other friends of the Bride, with atteſtatiō
before God and their idols, that hee deliuer
the dowry wholly and truely at the day appointed,
&amp; hold loue euer after, one kinred
with another. Wherupon they break the loaf
into pieces, &amp; eate of it, to teſtifie their true
&amp; ſincere meanings, for performing of that
charge, and thenceforth to become as grains
of one loafe, or men of one table.
            Theſe ceremonies being ended, the Bridegroome
taketh the Bride by the hand, and
ſo they goe on together, with their friendes
after them, towardes the Church porche.
Where meete thē certein with pots, &amp; cups
in their handes, with meade and Ruſſe wine.
Whereof the Bridegroome taketh firſt a
charke, or little cuppe full in his hand, and
drinketh to the Bride: who opening her
hood, or vale below, and putting the cup to
her mouth vnderneath it (for beeing ſeene
of the Bridegroome) pleadgeth him agayne.
Thus returning altogether from the

Church, the Bridegroome goeth not home
to his owne, but to his fathers houſe, and
ſhe likewiſe to hers, where either intertayn
their friends apart. At the entring into the
houſe, they vſe to fling corne out of the windowes,
vpon the Bridegroome, and Bride, in
token of plentie, and fruitfulnes to bee with
them euer after.
            When the Euening is come, the Bride is
brought to the Bridegrooms fathers houſe,
and there lodgeth that night, with her vale
or couer ſtill ouer her head. All that night
ſhe may not ſpeak one word (for that charge
ſhe receiueth by tradition from her mother,
and other matrones her friendes) that the
Bridegroome muſt neither heare, nor ſee
her, till the day after the marriage. Neither
three dayes after, may ſhee bee hearde to
ſpeake, ſaue certeyne fewe wordes at the table,
in a ſet forme with great manners, and
reuerence to the Bridegroome. If ſhe behaue
her ſelfe otherwiſe, it is a great preiudice
to her credite, and life euer after: and will
highly be diſliked of the Bridegroome himſelfe.
            After the third day, they depart to their
owne, and make a feaſt to both their friends
together. The marriage day, and the whole
time of their feſtiuall, the Bridegroome hath
the honour to bee called Moloday Knez,
               
or yong Duke, and the Bride Moloday Knezay,
or young Dutcheſſe.
            In liuing with their wiues, they ſhewe
themſelues to be but of a barbarous condition:
vſing them as ſeruants, rather then
wiues. Except the Noble-women, which are,
or ſeeme to be of more eſtimation with their
huſbands, then the reſt of meaner ſort. They
haue this fowle abuſe, contrary to good order,
and the worde of God it ſelfe, that vpon
diſlike of his wife, or other cauſe whatſoeuer,
the man may goe into a Monaſterie and
ſhire himſelfe a Frier, by pretence of deuotion:
and ſo leaue his wife to ſhift for her ſelfe
ſo well as ſhe can.
         
         
            Of the other Ceremonies of the
Ruſſe Church.
            The 25. Chapter.
            
               THe other ceremonies of
their Churche,The ſigne of the croſſe. are manie
in number: especially,
the abuſe about the ſigne
of the Croſſe, which they
ſet vp in their high wayes,
in the tops of their Churches,
and in euery doore of their houſes, ſigning

themſelues continually with it, on their
foreheads and breſts, with great deuotion,
as they will ſeeme by their outward geſture.
Which were leſſe offence, if they gaue not
withall, that religious reuerence and woorſhip
vnto it, which is due to God onely, and
vſed the dumbe ſhewe, and ſigning of it inſteede
of thankſgiuing, and of all other dueties
which they owe vnto God. When they
riſe in the morning, they goe commonly in
the ſight of ſome ſteeple, that hath acroſſe
on the toppe: and ſo bowing themſelues towardes
the croſſe, ſigne themſelues withal on
their foreheads, and breſts. And this is their
thankſgiuing to God for their nightes reſt,
without any word ſpeaking, except peraduenture
they ſay, Aſpody Pomeluy, or Lorde
haue mercie vpon vs. When they ſitte downe
to meate, and riſe againe from it, the thankſgiuing
to God, is the croſsing of their foreheads
and breſts. Except it be ſome few that
adde peraduenture, a worde or two of ſome
ordinarie prayer, impertinent to that purpoſe.
When they are to giue an oath for the
deciding of anie controuerſie at Lawe, they
doe it by ſwearing by the Croſſe, and kiſsing
the feet of it, making it as God, whoſe name
onely is to bee vſed in ſuch triall of iuſtice.
When they enter into any houſe (where euer
there is an idole hanging on the wall)

they ſigne themſelues with the croſſe, &amp; bow
themſelues to it. When they begin any work,
bee it little, or much they arme them ſelues
firſt with the ſigne of the croſſe. And this cō
               monly
is all their prayer to God, for good
ſpeede of their buſineſſe. And thus they
ſerue God with croſſes, after a croſſe and
vaine maner: not vnderſtanding what the
croſſe of Chriſt is, nor the power of it. And
yet they thinke all ſtrangers Chriſtians, to
be no better then Turkes, in compariſon of
themſelues (and ſo they wil ſay) becauſe they
bow not themſelues, when they meete with
the croſſe, nor ſigne themſelues with it, as
the Ruſſe maner is.
            They haue holie water in like vſe,Holywater. and eſtimation,
as the Popiſh Church hath. But
herein they exceede them, in that they doe
not onely hallow their holie water ſtockes,
and tubbes ful of water, but all the riuers of
the countrey once euery yeere.Hallowing of riuers. At Mosko it
is done with great pompe, and ſolemnitie:
the Emperour himſelfe being preſent at it,
with all his Nobility, marching through the
ſtreets towards the riuer of Moskua, in manner
of proceſsion in this order as followeth.
Firſt goe two Deacons, with banners in their
hands, the one of Precheſte (or our Ladie) the
other of S. Michael, fighting with his dragō.
Then follow after, the reſt of the Deacons &amp;

the prieſts of Mosko, two &amp; two in a ranke,
with coaps on their backs, and their idols at
their breſts, carried with girdles or ſlinges,
made faſt about their necks. Next the prieſts
come their Biſhops in their pontificalibus:
then the Friers, Monks, and Abbots: and after,
the Patriarches, in very rich attite, with a
ball, or ſphere on the top of his myter, to ſignifie
his vniuerſalitie ouer that Church. Laſt
commeth the Emperor with all his nobility.
The whole traine is of a mile long, or more.
When they are come to the riuer, a great
hole is made in the yſe, where the market is
kept, of a rod and a halfe broad, with a ſtage
round about it to keepe off the preſſe. Then
beginneth the Patriarch to ſay certaine praiers,
and coniureth the diuel to come out of
the water: and ſo caſting in ſalt, and cenſing
it with frankincenſe, maketh the whole riuer
to become holy water. The morning before,
all the people of Mosko vſe to make croſſes
of chawlke ouer euerie doore, and window
of their houſes: leaſt the Diuell beyng coniured
out of the water, ſhoulde flye into their
houſes.
            When the ceremonies are ended, you ſhal
ſee the black Gard of the Emperours houſe,
and then the reſt of the Towne, with their
pailes and buckets, to take off the hallowed
water for drinke, and other vſes. You ſhall

alſo ſee the women dippe in their children ouer
head and eares, and many men and women
leape into it, ſome naked, ſome with
their clothes on, when ſome man woulde
thinke his finger woulde freeſe off, if hee
ſhould but dippe it into the water. When
the men haue done, they bring their horſe
to the riuer, to drinke of the ſanctified water:
and ſo make them as holie as a horſe.
Their ſet day for this ſolemne action of hallowing
their riuers, is that we cal Twelfthday.
The like is done by other Biſhops, in al parts
of the Realme.
            Their maner is alſo to giue it to their ſick,
in their greateſt extremitie: thinking that it
will eyther recouer them,Drinking of holy water. or ſanctifie them
to God, Whereby they kill many, through
their vnreaſonable ſuperſtition, as did the
Lord Borris his onely ſonne at my beyng at
the Mosko: whom he killed (as was ſaid by
the phiſitions) by powring into him, colde
holie water, and preſenting him naked into
the Church, to their Saynt Baſileo, in the
colde of the Winter, in an extremitie of ſickneſſe.
            They haue an image of Chriſt, which
they call Neruchi, (which ſignifieth as much
as Made without hands) for ſo their prieſts, &amp;
ſuperſtition withal, perſwadeth them it was.
This in their proceſsions, they carry about

with them on high vpon a pole, encloſed
within a Pixe, made like a lanthorn, and doe
reuerence to it, as to a great myſterie.
            At euery brewing, their maner is likewiſe,Brewing with holy water.
to bring a diſh of their woort to the Prieſt,
within the Church: which beyng hallowed
by him, is powred into the brewing▪ and
ſo giueth it ſuch a vertue, as when they drink
of it, they are ſeldome ſober. The like they
doe with the firſt fruites of their corne in
Harueſt.
            They haue an other ceremonie on Palmſunday,Palmſunday.
of auncient tradition: what time the
Patriarch rideth through the Mosko, the Emperour
himſelf holding his horſe bridel, and
the people crying Hoſanna, &amp; ſpreding their
vpper garmentes vnder his horſe feete. The
Emperour hath of the Patriarch for his good
ſeruice of that day 200 rubbels of ſtanding
penſion. Another pageant they haue much
like to this, the weeke before the nativitie
of Chriſt▪ When euery Biſhop in his Cathedral
Church ſetteth forth a ſhew of the three
children in the Ouen. Where the Angell is
made to come flying from the roofe of the
Church, with great admiration of the lookers
on, and many terrible ſlaſhes of fire, are
made with roſen, and gun-powder, by the
Chaldians (as they call them) that run about
the towne all the twelue dayes, diſguiſed in

their plaiers coats, &amp; make much good ſport
for the honour of the Biſhops pageant. At
the Mosko, the Emperour himſelfe, and the
Empreſſe neuer faile to be at it, though it be
but the ſame matter plaid euery yeere, without
any new inuention at all.
            Beſides their faſtes on Wedneſdayes,Faſts. and
Fridayes throughout the whole yeere, (the
one becauſe they ſay Chriſt was ſolde on
the Wedneſday, the other becauſe he ſuffered
on the Friday) they haue foure great
Faſtes, or Lentes euery yeere. The firſt,
(which they call their great Lent) is at the
ſame time with ours. The ſecond, about
Midſommer. The third, in Harueſt time. The
fourth, about Hallontide: which they keepe
not of pollicie, but of meere ſuperſtition. In
their great Lent for the firſt weeke, they eate
nothing but bread and ſalt, and drinke nothing
but water, neither meddle with anie
matter of their vocation, but intende their
ſhriuing, and faſting only. They haue alſo 3.
Vigils, or Wakes in their great Lent, which
they cal Stoiania &amp; the laſt Friday their great
Vigil,
               Vigils. as they cal it. What time the whole pariſh
muſt bee preſent in the Church, and
watch from nine a clocke in the Euening, til
ſixe in the morning, all the while ſtanding,
ſaue when they fall downe, and knock their
heads to their idoles, which muſt be an hundred

and ſeuentie times, iuſt through the
whole night.
            About their burials alſo,Burials. they haue manie
ſuperſtitious and prophane ceremonies:
as putting within the finger of the corpes, a
letter to Saint Nicolas: whome they make
their chiefe mediatour, and as it were, the
porter of heauen gates, as the Papiſtes doe
their Peter.
            
            In Winter time, when all is couered with
ſnow, and the ground ſo hard frozen, as that
no ſpade, nor pikeaxe can enter their manner
is not to burie their dead, but to keepe
the bodies (ſo many as die all the Winter
time) in an houſe, in the ſuburbs, or outparts
of the towne, which they call Bohſedom, that
is, Gods houſe: where the dead bodies are pyled
vp together, like billets on a woodſtack,
as hard with the froſt as a very ſtone, till the
Springtide come, &amp; reſolueth the froſt: what
time euery man taketh his dead friend, and
committeth him to the ground.
            They haue beſides their yeeres and moneths
mindes,Moneths mindes. for their friendes departed.
What time they haue praiers ſaide ouer the
graue by the Prieſt: who hath a penie ordinarie
for his paines. When any dieth, they
haue ordinary women mourners, that come
to lament for the dead party: and ſtand howling
ouer the bodie, after a prophane, and

heatheniſh manner (ſometimes in the houſe,
ſomtimes bringing the bodie into the backſide
asking him what hee wanted, and what
he meant to die. They bury their dead, as the
party vſed to goe, with coate, hoſe, bootes,
hat and the reſt of his apparell.
            Many other vaine and ſuperſtitious ceremonies
they haue, which were long and tedious
to report. By theſe it may appeare, how
farre they are fallen from the true knowledge,
and practiſe of Chriſtian religion: hauing
exchanged the worde of God, for their
vaine traditions, and brought al to external,
and ridiculous ceremonies,
without any regard of ſpirite
and trueth, which God requireth
in his true
worſhip.
         
         
            
            Of the Emperours domeſtike, or
priuate behauiour.
            The 26. Chapter.
            
               THe Emperours
priuate behauiour,
ſo much as
may bee, or is
meete to bee
known, is after
this maner. Hee
riſeth cōmonly
about 4 a clock
in the morning.
After his apparrelling and waſhing, in commeth
his ghoſtly father, or prieſt of his chā
               ber,
which is named in their tongue, Otetz
Duhouna, with his croſſe in his hand, wherwith
he bleſſeth him, laying it firſt on his
forehead, then vpon his cheekes, or ſides of
his face, and then offreth him the ende of it
to kiſſe. This done, the Clearke of the croſſe
(called Chreſby Deyack Profery) bringeth into
his chamber, a painted image, repreſenting
the Saint for that day. For euery day
with them hath his ſeuerall Saint, as it were
the patrone for that day.His priuate prayer. This he placeth among
the reſt of his image gods, wherewithall

his chamber is decked, as thicke almoſt
as the wall can beare, with lampes and waxe
candles burning before them. They are very
coſtly and gorgeouſly decked with pearle,
and precious ſtone. This image being placed
before him, the Emperour beginneth
to croſſe himſelfe after the Ruſſe manner,
firſt on the forehead, then on both ſides
of his breaſte, with Aſpody Pomeluy, Pomeluy
mena hoſpody, ſacroy mena greſnick Syhodestua:
which is as much to ſay, as, Helpe me O
Lorde my God, Lorde comfort me, defende and
keepe me a ſinner from doing euill, &amp;c. This
hee directeth towardes the image, or Saynt
for that day, whom hee nameth in his prayer,
together with our Lady (whom they call
Precheſte) Saint Nicholas, or ſome other, to
whome he beareth moſt deuotion, bowing
himſelf proſtrate vnto them, with knocking
his head to the verie ground. Thus he continueth
the ſpace of a quarter of an houre, or
thereabouts.
            Then cōmeth againe the ghoſtly father, or
chāber prieſt, with a ſiluer bowle full of holy
water, which they call in Ruſſe, Sweta Voda, &amp;
a ſprinkle of Baſill (as they call it) in his hād:
&amp; ſo al to beſprinckleth firſt the image gods,
and then the Emperour. This holy water is
brought freſh euery day from the Monaſteries,
farre and neere, ſent to the Emperour

from the Abbot or Prior, in the name of the
Saint, that is patrone of that Monaſtery, as a
ſpeciall token of good wil from him.
            Theſe deuotions being ended, he ſendeth
in to the Empreſſe, to aske whether ſhe hath
reſted in health, &amp;c. And after a little
pawſe goeth himſelfe to ſalute her in a middle
roome betwixt both their chambers.
The Empreſſe lieth apart from him, and keepeth
not one chamber, nor table with the
Emperour ordinarily, ſaue vpon the eaue of
their Lentes, or common Faſtes: what time
ſhe is his ordinarie gheſt at bedde and
boorde. After their meeting in the morning,
they goe together to their priuate
Churche or Chappell, where is ſayde, or
ſoung a morning Seruice (called Zautrana)
of an houre long or thereabouts.The Emperour giueth preſence euery morning. From
the Church hee returneth home, and ſitteth
him downe in a great chamber, to be ſeene
and ſaluted by his Nobilitie, ſuch as are in
fauour about the Court. If hee haue to
ſay to anie of them, or they to him, then
is the time. And this is ordinarie, except
his health, or ſome other occaſion alter the
cuſtome.
            About nine in the morning, he goeth to
another Church within his Caſtle: where
is ſoung by Prieſts, and Choriſters, the high
Seruice (called Obeadna or Complin) which

commonly laſteth two houres: the Emperour
in the meane time▪ talking commonly
with ſome of his Councell, Nobilitie, or
captaines, which haue to ſay to him, or he to
them. And the Councell likewiſe conferre
together among themſelues, as if they were
in their councell houſe. This ended, he returneth
home, and recreateth himſelfe vntill it
be dinner time.
            He is ſerued at his table on this manner.
Firſt, euery diſh (as it is deliuered at the dreſſer)
is taſted by the Cooke,The Emperours ſeruice at his Table. in the preſence
of the high Stewarde, or his Deputie. And
ſo is receyued by the Gentlemen wayters
(called Shilſhey) and by them carried vp to
the Emperours table, the high Stewarde or
his Deputie going before. There it is receiued
by the Sewer (called Erastnoy) who
giueth a taſte of euerie diſhe to the Taſter,
and ſo placeth it before the Emperour. The
number of his diſhes for his ordinarie ſeruice
is about ſeuenty: dreſſed ſomwhat groſely,
with much garlicke, &amp; ſalt, much after the
Doutch manner. When hee exceedeth vpon
ſome occaſion of the day▪ or entertainment
of ſome Ambaſſador, he hath many more diſhes.
The ſeruice is ſent vp by 2. diſhes at a
time, or three at the moſt that he may eate it
warme, firſt the baked, then the roſt meats, &amp;
laſt the brothes. In his dyning chamber is an

other table: where ſit the chiefe of his Nobilitie
that are about his Court, and his
ghoſtly father, or Chapleine. On the one
ſide of the chamber ſtandeth a cubbard or
table of plate, very fayre and riche, with a
great ceſterne of Copper by it, full of yſe
and ſnow, wherein ſtande the pottes that
ſerue for that meale. The taſter holdeth the
cup that he drinketh in all dinner time, and
deliuereth it vnto him with a ſay, when hee
calleth for it. The manner is to make many
diſhes out of the ſeruice after it is ſet on
the table, and to ſend them to ſuch Noblemen
and officers, as the Emperour liketh
beſt. And this is counted a great fauour, and
honour.
            After dinner hee layeth him downe to
reſte, where commonly hee taketh three
houres ſleepe, except he employ one of the
houres to bathing, or boxing. And this cuſtome
for ſleeping after dinner, is an ordinary
matter with him, as withall the Ruſſes.
After his ſleepe, he goeth to euen ſong (called
Vechurna) and thence returning, for the
moſt parte recreateth himſelf with the Empreſſe
till ſupper time, with ieſters, and
dwarfes, men and women, that tumble before
him, and ſing many ſongs after the Ruſſe
manner. This is his common recreation
betwixt meales, that hee moſte delightes in.

On other ſpeciall recreation is the fight with
wilde Beares, which are caught in pittes, or
nets, and are kepte in barred cages for that
purpoſe, againſt the Emperour be diſpoſed
to ſee the paſtime. The fight with the Beare
is on this ſort. The man is turned into a circle
walled round about, where he is to quite
himſelfe ſo well as he can: for there is no way
to flie out. When the Beare is turned looſe
he commeth vpon him with open mouth.
If at the firſt puſhe hee miſſe his aime, ſo that
the Beare come within him, hee is in great
daunger. But the wilde Beare being very
fearſe, hath this qualitie, that giueth aduantage
to the Hunter. His manner is when
he aſſaileth a mā, to riſe vp right on his two
hinder legges, and ſo to come roaring with
open mouth vpon him. And if the Hunter
then can puſhe right into the very breſt of
him betwixt his forelegges (as commonly
hee will not miſſe) reſting the other ende of
their boareſpeare at the ſide of his foote, &amp; ſo
keeping the pike ſtill towards the face of the
Beare, he ſpeedeth him cōmōly at one blow.
But many times theſe Hunters come ſhort,
and are either ſlaine, or miſerably torne with
the teeth &amp; talents of the fierce beaſt. If the
partie quite himſelfe well in this fight with
the Beare, he is carried to drinke at the Emperours
ſeller doore: where he drinketh himſelfe

drunke for the honor of Hospodare. And
this is his rewarde for aduenturing his life,
for the Emperours pleaſure. To maintain this
paſtime the Emperor hath certein huntſmen
that are appointed for that purpoſe to take
the wild Beare. This is his recreation commonly
on the holy daies. Somtimes he ſpendeth
his time in looking vpō his goldſmiths,
and Iewellers, tailers, embroderers, painters,
&amp; ſuch like, &amp; ſo goeth to his ſupper. When
it draweth towaeds bed time, his prieſt ſaieth
certein praiers: and then the Emperour bleſſeth
and croſſeth himſelfe, as in the morning
for a quarter of an houre or thereaboutes,
and ſo goeth to his bedde.
            The Emperour that now is (called Theodore
Iuanowich) is for his perſon of a meane
ſtature, ſomewhat lowe and groſſe, of a
ſallowe complexion, and inclining to the
dropſie, hawke noſed, vnſteady in his paſe
by reaſon of ſome weakenes of his lims, heauie
and vnactiue, yet commonly ſmiling almoſt
to a laughter. For qualitie otherwiſe,
ſimple and ſlowe witted, but verie gentle,
and of an eaſie nature, quiet, mercifull, of no
martiall diſpoſition, nor greatly apt for matter
of pollicie, very ſuperſtitious, and infinite
that way. Beſides his priuate deuotions at
home, he goeth euery weeke cōmonly on pilgrimage
to ſome Monaſterie, or other that

is neareſt hand. He is of 34. yeares old, or
thereaboutes, and hath reigned almoſt the
ſpace of ſixe yeares.

            Of the priuate behauiour, or qualitie
of the Ruſſe people.
            The 28. Chapter.
            
               THe priuate behauiour
and qualitie of
the Ruſſe people,Conſtitution of their bodies.
may partly be vnderſtood
by that
whiche hath beene
ſaid cōcerning the
publique ſtate and
vſage of the countrie.
As touching
the naturall habite of their bodies, they are
for the moſt parte of a large ſiſe, and of very
fleſhly bodies: accounting it a grace to bee
ſomewhat groſſe and burley, and therefore
they nouriſh and ſpread their beardes, to
haue them long and broad. But for the moſt
part they are very vnweldy &amp; vnactiue withall.
Which may bee thought to come partly
of the climate, and the numbnes which they
get by the cold in winter, and partly of their
diet that ſtandeth moſt of rootes, onions,
garlike, cabbage, and ſuch like things that
breed groſſe humors, which they vſe to eate
alone, and with their other meates.
            
               
Their diet is rather much then curious
At their meales they beginne commonly
with a Chark or ſmall cuppe of Aqua vitae,
               Their diet.
(which they call Ruſſe wine) and then drinke
not till towardes the ende of their meales,
taking it in largely, and all together, with
kiſsing one another, at euery pledge. And
therefore after dinner there is no talking
with them, but euery man goeth to his bench
to take his afternoones ſleepe, which is as
ordinary with them as their nightes reſte.
When they exceede, and haue varietie of
diſhes, the firſt are their baked meates (for
roſte meates they vſe little) and then their
broathes, or pottage. To drinke drunke, is
an ordinary matter with them euery day in
the weeke. Their common drinke is Mead,
the poorer ſort vſe water, and a thin drinke
called Quaſſe, which is nothing els (as wee
ſay) but water turned out of his wittes, with
a little branne meaſhed with it.
            This diet would breede in them many
diſeaſes, but that they vſe bathſtoues, or hote
houſes in ſteede of all phiſicke, commonly
twiſe or thriſe euery weeke. All the winter
time, and almoſt the whole Sommer, they
heat there Peaches, which are made lyke the
Germane bathſtoaues, and their Potlads like
ouens, that ſo warme the houſe, that a ſtraunger
at the firſt ſhall hardly like of it. Theſe

two extremities, ſpecially in the winter of
heat within their houſes, and of extreame
colde without, together with their diet, maketh
them of a darke, and ſallow complexion,
their skinnes beyng tanned and parched
both with colde and with heate: ſpecially
the women, that for the greater parte are
of farre worſe complexions, then the men.
Whereof the cauſe take to bee their keeping
within the hote houſes, and buſying
themſelues about the heating, and vſing of
their bathſtoues, and peaches.
            The Ruſſe becauſe that hee is vſed to
both theſe extremities of heat and of cold,
can beare them both a great deale more
patiently, then ſtraungers can doo. You
ſhal ſee them ſometimes (to ſeaſon their bodies)
come out of their bathſtoues all on a
froth, and fuming as hote almoſt as a pigge
at a ſpitte, and preſently to leape into the
riuer ſtarke naked, or to powre colde water
all ouer their bodies, and that in the
coldeſt of all the winter time. The women
to mende the bad hue of their skinnes, vſe
to paint their faces with white and redde colours,
ſo viſibly, that euery man may perceyue
it. Which is made no matter, becauſe
it is common, and liked well by their
huſbandes: who make their wiues and
daughters anordinarie allowance to buy
them colours to paint their faces withall,

and delight themſelues much to ſee them
of fowle women to become ſuch faire images.
This parcheth the skinne and helpeth to
deforme them when their painting is of.
            They apparell themſelues after the
Greeke manner.The Noble mans attire. The Noblemans attire is
on this faſhion. Firſt a Taffia or little night
cappe on his head, that couereth little more
then his crowne, commonlie verie riche
wrought of ſilke and gold thread, &amp; ſet with
pearle &amp; pretious ſtone. His head he keepeth
ſhauen cloſe to the very skin, except he be in
ſome diſpleaſure with the Emperour. Then
hee ſuffereth his haire to growe and hang
downe vpon his ſhoulders, couering his face
as vgly and deformedly as he can, Ouer the
Taffia he weareth a wide cap of black Foxe
(which they account for the beſt furre) with
a Tiara or long bonnet put within it, ſtanding
vp like a Perſian or Babilonian hat. About
his neck (which is ſeene al bare) is a coller
ſet with pearle and pretious ſtone, about
three or foure fingers broad. Next ouer his
ſhirt, (which is curiouſly wrought, becauſe he
ſtrippeth himſelfe into it in the Sommer
time, while he is within the houſe) is a Shepon,
or light garment of ſilke made downe to the
knees, buttoned before: &amp; then a Caftan or a
cloſe coat buttoned, and girt to him with a
Perſian girdle, whereat he hanges his kniues
and ſpoone. This commonly is of cloth of

gold, and hangeth downe as low as his ankles,
Ouer that he weareth a loſe garment of
ſome rich ſilke, furred and faced about with
ſome gold lace, called a Ferris. An other ouer
that of chamlet, or like ſtuffe called an Alkaben,
ſleeued &amp; hanging low, and the cape
commonly brooched▪ and ſet all with pearle.
When hee goeth abroad, he caſteth ouer all
theſe (which are but ſleight (though they
ſeeme to be many) an other garment called
an Honoratkey, like to the Alkaben, ſaue that
it is made without a coller for the neck. And
this is commonly of fine cloth, or Camels
haire. His bus kins (which he weareth in ſtead
of hoſe, with linnen folles vnder them in
ſteed of boot hoſe) are made of a Perſian leather
called Saphian, embrodered with pearle.
His vpper ſtockes commonly are of cloth of
gold. When he goeth abroad, he mounteth
on horſebacke, though it be but to the next
doore: which is the manner alſo of the Boiarskey,
or Gentlemen.
            The Boiarskey or Gentlemans attire is
of the ſame faſhion,The Gentlemans apparell. but differeth in ſtuffe:
and yet he will haue his Caftan or vndercoat
ſometimes of cloth of gold, the reſt of cloth,
or ſilke.
            The Noble woman (called Chyna Boiarſhena)
weareth on hir head,The Noble womans attire. firſt a caull of
ſome ſoft ſilke (which is commonly redde)
and ouer it a fruntlet, called Obroſa of white

colour. Ouer that hir cap (made after the
coife faſhion of cloth of gold) called Shapka
Zempska, edged with ſome riche furre, and
ſet with pearle and ſtone. Though they haue
of late begonne to diſdaine embrodering
with pearle about their cappes, becauſe the
Diacks, and ſome Marchants wiues haue taken
vp the faſhion. In their eares they weare
earerings (which they call Sargee) of two
inches or more compaſſe, the matter of gold
ſet with Rubies, or Saphires, or ſome like
pretious ſtone. In Sommer they goe often
with kerchieffes of fine white lawne, or Cambricke,
faſtned vnder the chinne, with two
long taſſels pendent. The kerchiefe ſpotted
and ſet thicke with rich pearle. When they
ride or goe abroad in raynie weather, they
weare white hattes with coloured bands (called
Stapa Zemskoy). About their necks they
were collers of three or foure fingers broad,
ſet with riche pearle and pretious ſtone.
Their vpper garment is a looſe gowne called
Opoſhen commonly of skarlet, with wide
looſe ſleeues, hanging downe to the ground
buttened before with great gold buttons, or
at leaſt ſiluer and guilt night as bigge as a walnut.
Which hath hanging ouer it faſtned
vnder the cappe, a large broad cape of ſome
riche furre, that hangeth downe almoſt to
the middes of their backes. Next vnder the
Oposken or vpper garment, they weare another

called a Leitnick that is made cloſe before
with great wide ſleeues, the cuffe or half
ſleeue vp to the elbowes, commonly of cloth
of golde: and vnder that a Ferris Zemskoy,
which hangeth looſe buttoned throughout
to the very foote. On the hand wreſts they
weare very faire braſelets, about two fingers
broad of pearle and pretious ſtone. They
go all in buskins of white, yellow, blew,
or ſome other coloured leather, embrodered
with pearle. This is the attire of the Noblewoman
of Ruſſia, when ſhee maketh the
beſt ſhew of hir ſelfe. The Gentlewomans
apparell may differ in the ſtuffe, but is all
one for the making or faſhion.
            As for the poore Mouſick and his wife
they go poorely cladde.The Mouſicks or cō
                  mon mans attire. The man with his
Odnoratkey, or looſe gowne to the ſmall of
the legge, tyed together with a lace before, of
courſe white or blew cloth, with ſome Shube
or long waſtcoat of furre, or of ſheepskinne
vnder it, and his furred cappe, and buskins.
The poorer ſort of them haue their Odnoratkey,
or vpper garment, made of Kowes haire.
This is their winter habite. In the ſommer
time, commonly they weare nothing but
their ſhirts on their backes, and buskins on
their legges. The woman goeth in a redde or
blew gowne, when ſhe maketh the beſt ſhew,
and with ſome warme Shube of furre vnder
it in the winter time. But in the Sommer, nothing

but her two ſhirts (for ſo they call thē)
one ouer the other, whether they be within
doores, or without. On their heades, they
weare caps of ſome coloured ſtuffe, many of
veluet, or of cloth of golde: but for the moſt
part kerchiefes. Without earings of ſiluer or
ſome other mettall, and her croſſe about her
necke, you ſhal ſee no Ruſſe woman, be ſhee
wife, or maide.
            As touching their behauiour,Their wits and capacities. and quality
otherwiſe, they are of reaſonable capacities,
if they had thoſe means that ſome other nations
haue to traine vp their wittes in good
nurture, and learning. Which they might
borrowe of the Polonians; and other their
neighbours, but that they refuſe it of a very
ſelf pride, as accounting their owne faſhions
to be far the beſt. Partly alſo (as I ſaid before)
for that their manner of bringing vp (voide
of all good learning, and ciuill behauiour) is
thought by their gouernours moſt agreable
to that State, and their manner of gouernment.
Which the people would hardely
beare, if they were once ciuilled, &amp; brought
to more vnderſtanding of God, and good
policie. This cauſeth the Emperours to keep
out al meanes of making it better, and to be
very warie for excluding of all peregrinitie,
that might alter their faſhions. Which were
leſſe to bee diſliked, if it ſet not a print into
the very mindes of his people. For as themſelues

are verie hardlie and cruellie dealte
withall by their chiefe Magiſtrates, and other
ſuperiours, ſo are they as cruell one againſt
an other, ſpecially ouer their inferiours,
and ſuch as are vnder them. So that
the baſeſt &amp; wretchedeſt Chriſtianoe (as they
call him) that ſtoupeth and croucheth like a
dogge to the Gentleman, and licketh vp the
duſt that lieth at his feete, is an intollerable
tyrant,Crueltie of the Ruſſe people. where he hath the aduantage. By this
meanes the whole Countrie is filled with
rapine, and murder. They make no account
of the life of a man. You ſhall haue a man
robbed ſometime in the very ſtreats of their
townes, if hee goe late in the euening: and
yet no man to come forth out of his doores
to reſcue him, though hee heare him crie
out. I will not ſpeake of the ſtraungeneſſe
of the murders, and other cruelties committed
among them, that would ſcarſly bee
beleeued to bee done among men, ſpecially
ſuch as profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians.
            The number of their vagrant and begging
poore is almoſt infinite: that are ſo
pinched with famine and extreame neede,
as that they begge after a violent and deſperate
manner, with giue mee and cut mee,
giue mee and kill mee, and ſuch like phraſes.
Whereby it may bee gheaſſed, what they are
towardes ſtraungers, that are ſo vnnaturall
and cruell towardes their owne. And yet it

may bee doubted whither is the greater, the
crueltie or intemperancie that is vſed in that
countrie.Intemperancie. I will not ſpeake of it, becauſe it is
ſo soule and not to bee named. The whole
countrie ouerfloweth with all ſinne of that
kinde. And no marueile, as hauing no lawe
to reſtraine whoredomes, adulteries, and like
vncleanneſſe of life.
            As for the truth of his word, the Ruſſe
for the moſt part maketh ſmall regard of it,
ſo he may gaine by a lie, and breache of his
promiſe. And it may be ſaide truely (as they
know beſt that haue traded moſt with them)
that from the great to the ſmall (except ſome
fewe that will ſcarcely be founde) the Ruſſe
neither beleeueth any thing that an other
man ſpeaketh, nor ſpeaketh any thing himſelfe
worthie to be beleeued. Theſe qualities
make thē very odious to all their neighbours,
ſpecially to the Tartars, that account
themſelues to be honeſt and iuſt, in compariſion
of the Ruſſe. It is ſuppoſed by ſome
that doe well conſider of the ſtate of both
countries, that the offence they take at the
Ruſſe gouernment, and their maner of behauiour,
hath beene a great cauſe to keepe
the Tartar ſtill Heatheniſh, and to miſlike
(as he doeth) of the Chriſtian
profeſsion.
