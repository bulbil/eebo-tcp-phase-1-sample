            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                        LYeurgus enioyned the people to offer little Sacrifices vnto their Gods, for (ſaith hee) they reſpect more the inward affection, then the outward Action: So in a Dedicatory imitation, I preſume to preſent this little ſacrifice of my future ſeruice, (oh were it worthy of your Honors acceptance) vnto your Honorable ſelfe, hoping your Honor will more regard the inward deuotion, then the outward Oblation: and happy is this little labour, if it may merit the portion of your Noble protection, much more of your Approbation, that ſo being graced with the mild aſpect of ſo propitious, and Noble a ſtarre of Honor, it may be the more welcome to the world; and others inuited to read it for your Honors ſake, though not for the worke ſake.
                  And vnder whoſe Honorable ſhadow may this Treatiſe, Britanniae vota, or, God ſaue the King, more ſurely, and ſafely ſhelter, then vnder yours, who

night and day deuoutly ſay, and pray, God ſaue the King: whoſe approoued fidelity in Kings-ſeruice hath mooued God and the King to promote you to great dignity, which you grace with ſuch Chriſtian, yet Courtly humility, that both in Church, Court, and Country, you are highly and worthily honored: Heerein your Honor followes thoſe Noble patternos Celarinus, and Aurelius of whom S.

So long as their King is well, they follow their worke; but being loſt, they leaue and loath their Hony-combes, and

when their king waxes olde and cannot flie, fert ipſum turba apum, they carry him on their wings, Et ſi moritur, 
                        Pet: Chry. in Policrat. lib. 7. 
                        moriuntur &amp; ipſae: And if hee die they die with him, as ſome write. Behold how nature hath ſtamped obedience by inſtinct to Bees, to bee ſubiect to a ſuperiour in their kinde; how much more ſhould nature, reaſon, and grace, ſtampe obedience in the hearts of Chriſtians, knowing that without a kingly gouernment, Kingdomes are thraldomes, remota iuſtitia quid ſunt regna niſi magna latrocinia, ſaith Aug. de ciuit. des lib. 4. c. 4. 
                        Auſten, Take away Iuſtice, and what are kingdomes but dens of theeues? Take away obedience to gouernment, and that were miſcere terris Tartara, make earth and hell all one, but only in name. There is not wanting diuine precepts, or diuine patternes, to allure loyall obedience: take two in ſtead of many; the firſt and beſt of all, our Sauiour Chriſt, 
                        Math. 3. 17. in whom God is well pleaſed: and the ſecond, Dauid, 
                        1 Sam. 13. 14. a man after Gods owne heart: Our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt (yet God and man) in the daies of his fleſh diſdained not to obey ſuch as were in authority, Math. 22. 21. commanding to giue vnto Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and paying Math. 17. 27. tribute to Caeſar for himſelfe and Peter, by the hands of Peter, though Peters ſuppoſed ſucceſſors will pay none. And though our Sauiour Chriſt receiued manifold iniuries and indignities from vniuſt and faithleſſe Gouernours, yet he neuer moued rebellion or reſiſtance, but digeſted all with patience and obedience, knowing that the powers that be are ordained of God: telling Pilate that vniuſt Iudge, that his power was Iohn. 19. 11. 
                        Datadeſuper, giuen him from aboue; for the Wiſd. 6. 3. rule is giuen of the Lord, and power of the moſt high: Deo obediendum eſt propter ſe, tanquam ſummo domino, magiſtratui propter deum tanquam illius miniſtro; ſaith one, Piſcat. anal. in Matth. 22. 21. God is to bee obeyed for himſelfe, being chiefe Lord, the Magiſtrate is to bee obeyed for God, as being Gods Miniſter or deputie. So that the patterne of Chriſts obedience to temporall powers, Omnis Chriſti actio eſt noſtra inſtructio. muſt be our platforme of inſtruction in the duty of obedience. 2. Dauids obedience to King Saul is very commendable and remarkeable: Saul was a A Tyrant by abuſe of power, not by vſurpatiō. Tyrant, &amp; ſought

without cauſe or colour to kill Dauid; yet Dauid often hazarded his life and limmes againſt Sauls enemies the Philiſtines, euermore teſtifying his prompt obedience and ſeruice to his Soueraigne; and when this King Saul (like that other Acts. 9. 1. 
                        Saul) breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt Dauid, following him to the wilderneſſe of Engedi (where Dauid vſed pia fallacia, hid himſelfe in a 1 Sam. 24. 4. Caue) and had opportunity to cut off Sauls head, as well as the lappe 5 of his garment; or if hee were timorous to dip his hand in bloud, as once a Gregory 
                        Greg: lib. 7. epiſt. 1. willed Sabinian to tell the Emperor, exciting him againſt the Lombards, Timeo Deum, &amp; metuo habere manum in ſanguine alicuius, I feare God, and am afraid to haue any hand in bloud: (oh that Popes had now hearts like Gregory, fearefull to Pope Iulius the ſecond by his means in 7 years deſtroied 200000 Chriſtiās. Geneb.
                         ſhedde bloud) if I ſay Dauid had ſuch a qualme of feare come ouer his heart, lo, the 1 Sam. 24. 8. hands of his ſeruants ready to haue done it, and ſcarce could be kept from it, onely Dauid doth terrifie them from doing it: 7 The Lord keepe mee from doing that thing vnto my Maſter the Lords Anointed, to lay my hands vpon him, for he is the Lords Annointed. Dum timuit oleum ſeruauit inimicum, as excellently Lib. 2. aduerſ: Parmenianum. 
                        Optatus, in fearing the annointing, he preſerued his enemie. But after this obedient fidelity performed by Dauid to King Saul, behold the ſickneſſe of that Tyrant, ſuſpition moues Saul ſtill to perſecute Dauid, the Ziphims 
                        1 Sam. 26. 1. tell Saul, Dauid hides himſelfe in the hill of Hachilah. In a worde, Dauid might haue killed Saul ſleeping, or if hee would not himſelfe do it, 8 
                        Abiſhai offred his ſeruice, I pray thee let me ſmite him once with a ſpeare to the earth, and I will ſmite him no more; but ſtil ſee how obedience holds his hands and moues his tongue, Deſtroy

                        him not, for who can lay his hand on the Lords Annointed, and be guilt leſſe? And afterward Saul being ſlaine, and a certaine Amalckite hoping to haue beene a happy Poſt in telling 2 Sam. 14. 
                        Dauid, Saul is dead, and ſhewing Dauid that hee haſted 10 
                        Sauls death, (though 1 Sam. 31. 4. 
                        Saul himſelfe had acted the Prologue of his owne death, this made the Epilogue of his life) and brought the Crowne in his hand, (a tempting bait to gette

praiſe or pardon) yet all in vaine: how waſt thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to deſtroy the anointed of the Lord? ſaith 2 Sam. 1. 14. 15. 
                        Dauid; and commands his ſeruant to giue him legem talionis: to kill this King-killer, though by conſent and intreaty.

                           Sic pereant, &amp; qui moliri talia pergunt.
                        
                        
                           So let them periſh, who ſuch deeds doe cheriſh.
                        
                     
                     What doe all theſe particulars ſummed vp together, but inferre this Ecce, 
                        Iohn 1. 47 Behold a true Iſraelite in whom is no guile; Behold a good Subiect in whom is no treaſon? Dauid was not ſicke of the Kings euill, Treaſon: he was not like the Popiſh Ieſuites, who diſpute againſt Kings altogether in Ferio; labouring to verifie Iuuenals verſe, Ad generum Cereris ſine caede, &amp; ſanguine pauci—deſcendunt reges.—All their arguments and actions like Dracos lawes, bloody: but Dauid was not matriculated in the Schoole of Traytors; euer obedient and loyall to his Soueraigne, faithfull in his obedience, aduenturing his body &amp; blood for the ſeruice of Saul, in defence againſt his enemies, and might truly ſay with Scaliger in his warfare, for King Sauls welfare: Pugnaui pedes, eques, adoleſcens, iuuenis, miles, praefectus, certamine ſingulari, in obſidionibus, in campo ciuili, in excurſionibus, in exercitibus ſaepius vici: aliquando victus ſum, corpore, non animo, non virtute, ſed facto, &amp;c. As vertuous and valorous Scaliger writes of himſelfe: ſo Dauid oftentimes fought againſt Sauls profeſſed enemies, Goliah the Philiſtine, the Amalekites, &amp;c: as from the ſeauenteenth Chapter of the firſt of Samuel, almoſt to the end of that Booke, is the very muſter Booke of Dauids warres for Sauls welfare: ſo that I may ſay with Lucianus in Scytha. 
                        Toxaris, who ſeeing his Countryman Anacbarſes in Athens, told him, that he would ſhew him all the wonders of Greece at once, viſo Solone, vidiſti omnia: ſo I may ſay, viſo Dauide, vidiſti ſatis. The obedience of Dauid to King Saul is ſufficient to inſtruct a Subiect.

                           Lucanus—Quid ſatis eſt? ſi Romaparum?
                        
                     
                     If this be not ſufficient, nothing will ſuffice; but the enemies of Caeſars will peraduenture reply and ſay; God ſaue

good Kings, but for bad Kings (ſay they) we pray God, or good men ſend them to their graues: and this doctrine de depoſitione regis, diſpoſitione regni, aut depriuatione vitae, to depoſe a King, or diſpoſe of his Kingdome, or depriue him of his life, if he be not (as they count) Catholicke, the reſolute generation of martiall Ignatius Loyola

                     It is an eaſie taske to ſhew, that loyall obedience is to be performed to wicked Kings, as our former inſtances of the beſt note, Chriſts obedience, and Dauids obedience to Saul, make it manifeſt; it is due to them, omni iure naturali, ciuili, morali, municipali, diuino; by the law of nature, ciuill, morall, municipall, diuine: we will onely proue it due by the laſt, by diuine law; if that proue it, who dare denie it? The Apoſtle Rom. 13. 1, makes the matter plaine. Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher Powers, for there is no power but of God, &amp;c: from which place I argue thus. All Powers that are ordained of God, muſt be obeyed: The higher Powers (be they good or bad) are ordained of God.
                        
                           Ergo—to be obeyed.

                        Peter who wrot his firſt Epiſtle in the time of the raigne of that wicked Emperour Claudius, as Baronius coniectured, exhorts all people to feare God, and to honour the King, 1 Pet. 2. 17: and that for the Lords ſake, v. 13. Yet this Claudius was a moſt wicked Emperour, maintaining many Ethnicke ſuperſtitions and worſhip of Idols, he was (as Suetonius 
                        Sueton. c. 34 writes of him) Natura ſaeuus, ſanguinarius, &amp; libidinoſus, 
                        33. by nature cruell, bloody, and libidinous; yet to this Emperour a Tyrant and an Infidell,

Saint Peter exhorts the faithfull Iewes to obedience: Saint Paul who liued vnder the ſame Emperour (as Rhemiſt. in tab: Paul. ſome doe thinke) writes to the Romans the Emperors Subiects, exhorts all to ſubmit themſelues, not in any colourable or diſſembled obedience, but propter Conſcientiam, v. 4: for conſcience ſake. Let vs heare a voyce or two of the ancient Fathers that liued in old time: Tertullian (who as In Catalog: ſcriptor: Eccleſ. 
                        Ierome ſaith) flouriſhed vnder the raigne of Seuerus the Emperor, who was a great Tyrant, an Infidell, and an enemy to Chriſtianity, who in the fift perſecution after Nero, troubled the Chriſtian VVorld, Saeuiſſima perſecutione, with moſt cruell perſecution (as Baron, An. Chriſti 205. ſome write), yet teacheth that all Subiects ſhould both Bene velle, bene dicere, &amp; bene facere, wiſh well, ſpeake well, and doe well for the Emperor, the which three-fold Bene comprehends all loyall duties: The firſt Ad Cor. 2. Ad Linguam: 3. Ad opus; as the Ianſen. c. 40: Concord. 
                        Ieſuite rightly teacheth, in thought, word, and deed, to be obedient. So Iuſtin 
                        Apolo 2: Ad Anton: Imperat. 
                        Martyr, in the name of all Chriſtians ſpeakes to the Emperor Antoninus, an infidell and a perſecutor Bellar: in Chronol:, in theſe words; Nos ſolum deum adoramus, &amp; vobis in rebus alijs laeti inſeruimus: VVe worſhip onely God, and in other matters are ioyfull to ſerue you. So Saint Ambroſ. Epiſt. lib. 5. Epiſt. 33 
                        Ambroſe would not wiſh the people of Millan to diſobey the Emperour Valentinian, yet a fauourer and follower of the Arrian Hereſie: If the Emperor (ſaith he) abuſe his imperial Iulianus Imp: Apoſtata habebat ſub ſe Chriſtianos milites, quibus cum diceret producite aciem &amp; obediebant ei

I will take delight in both; Oh Theologicall voice, Oh Epiſcopall obedience. Theſe were the voices of the holy Fathers in the ancient times: I but, will ſome Popiſh Aduerſary to the regall ſupremacy reply, the times muſt be conſidered, the people wanted power to reſiſt. No, no, that was not the matter: when Iulian did dominere, who was an Apoſtate and an Idolater, as Auguſt: in Pſ. 12

                        Auſtin; yet his Souldiers, who were for the moſt part Chriſtians, did obey him without reſiſtance in all military matters and publike ſeruices,

yet they then had power to haue reſiſted him; for moſt of Iulians Army did conſiſt of Chriſtians, as their Socrat. lib. 3. ca. 22 voices to Iouinian his Succeſſor declare, Omnes vna voce confeſſi ſunt ſe eſſe Chriſtianos, as Ruff. lib. 2. hiſtor. c. 1 Regi ethnico fidem non praeſtare nefas. 
                        Ruffinus records it; with a generall voice they all confeſſed themſelues Chriſtians: So Conſtantius and 
                           Ʋalens wicked Emperors, and fauourers of the Arrian Hereſie, yet we doe not reade of any of the Orthodoxe Chriſtianity, that diſobeyed them by rebellion or reſiſtance. Then Bellarmines

Vnworthy is that Creature to breathe the Ayre, which denies honour to the breathing Image of God, his annointed Soueraign, or with vnreuerent action, or elocution, enterpriſe to debaſe their ſacred Soueraignety; ſuch tongues are worthy with Diues to be tormented, or with Progne to be cut out, or with Nicanors to be diuided in crummes for Birds, that will not honour with tongues, and honour with hearts their annointed and appointed Kings, the earthly pictures of the King of Kings.

                        THE fourth duty of Subiects, to be duly rendred and tendered to their annointed Soueraignes, is loyall and faithfull ſeruice, thinking themſelues (as Tiberius ſaid of his People) Homines ad ſeruitutem nati, Men borne to doe them ſeruice: And therefore it was a commendable order (as Praef: Com. in Epiſt: ad Rom. Quireip. hoſtis eſt; is ciuis eſſe nullo modo poteſt. Cic. in Cat. 4 
                        Melancthon records it) that euery Citizen did ſweare, taking a corporall Oath, Pugnabo pro ſacris pro legibus, pro aris, &amp; focis, &amp; ſolus, &amp; ſimul cum alijs; &amp; ne patriam meam deteriorem qua accepi, poſteris tradam, omnibus viribus enitar, I will

fight for Religion, for our lawes, &amp;c: alone &amp; with others, and I will with all my might rather endeauour to better, then to make worſe my Countrey to poſterity; acknowledging themſelues ſeruants to their Countrey, and vowing their beſt endeauours to doe her faithfull ſeruice. So all true ſubiects are bound by the Lawes of God and men, to be faithfull ſeruants to their Soueraignes: and if they neglect or reiect this duty, I may ſay to them as 1 Sam. 26. 15. 16 
                        Dauid did to Abner, Ye be worthy to die, becauſe ye haue not kept your Maſter the Lords Annointed, becauſe you haue not been faithfull ſeruants to your anointed Soueraignes. If any Eſter 2. 21. 22

And for the performance of this loyall ſeruice to their appointed Soueraignes, no condition of men vnder the Sunne can pleade immunity, neither Popes, Prieſts, nor People; the Pope cannot pleade priuiledge, if he will ſtand to his owne and Humilitas in voce, ſuperbia in actione, Greg. Seruus ſeruorum, Tyrannus Tyrannorum. old title, Seruus ſeruorum, A ſeruant of Seruants: but he carries himſelfe now adayes as if his Prentiſhip were out, and would change his ſtile to be Dominus Dominorum, A Lord ouer his Lord; as the old Illyric: Poem de corrup. ſtat. Eccleſiae. Poet tels vs,

                           Roma tibi quondam fuerant Domini Dominorum,
                           Seruorum ſerui nunc tibiſunt Domini.
                        
                     
                     For he diſclaimes in action his old appellation, the ſeruant of ſeruants, &amp; neuer vſes it but by way of equiuocation. But to let him goe: for Senex pſittacus non capit ferulam, 
                        Ita aequivoci, vt vniuoci raro.
                        
He is too old to learne, and happy are thoſe Kings, that haue leaſt part of his ſeruice; but if it pleaſe the Pope to be like the High Prieſts, (and I thinke that title is high enough for him) they were content to call themſelues ſeruants vnto Kings, as Abimilech accounted himſelfe Sauls ſeruant; 1 Chro 29. 22: 7 1 Sam. 22. 15 Let not the King impute any thing vnto his ſeruant, &amp;c. And Zadocke

                        Ieſuite, Their chiefe Prieſts were ſubiects and ſeruants to Kings in the Law: and the chiefe Apoſtle euen Saint Peter, from whom they would fetch their Pedegree of Primacy, enioynes all in the Goſpell to ſubmit themſelues for the Lords ſake, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the 1 Peter 213 ſuperior. So that their freedome from ſeruice to the Princes of the Earth, hath no warrant, except from the Prince of the Ayre, to whom Rome dedicates her ſcepter and ſeruice. And this loyall ſeruice of the members vnto the royall and Princely Head, ought to be dutifull, faithfull, and perpetuall: that is the happy ſeruice, which comes from an hearty obedience; many things may ſeeme ſo in apparance, which are not ſo in eſlence: It is the practiſe and very Nulla eſt peſtis capitalior quam eorum, qui tunc cum maxime fallunt, id agunt, vt boni viri videantur: Cic. lib.

Naturally euery one loues his Country, Nemo patriam diligit quia magna eſt, ſed quia ſua eſt, ſaith Sen: de remed. fort:

It was an excellent ſaying of Aulus Fuluius, who finding his ſonne in the conſpiracy of Catiline, tells him, Ego non te Catilinae genui, ſed Patriae, I did beget thee not for Catiline, but for thy Country. They that are Traytors to their King and Country, may fitly be compared to Vipers: The Vipers are conceiued (as Nat. hiſt: lib. 10. cap. 62.

Our Engliſh Fugitiues are the ſpawnes of theſe Vipers, Parſons, Saunders, &amp;c. who becauſe they could not eate through her bowels and belly with their teeth, in reuenge raile at her with their tongues; to whom I cannot giue a fitter anſwer then that which the Eſtate of Engliſh fugitiues.

                        Cicero, It is the office of a King to take care and counſell for the welfare of his people: Princeps ſuorum ſubditorū velut ſui ipſius corporis membrorum curam gerit, ſaith Agapetus, A Prince takes care of all his Subiects, euen as the members of his owne bodie. And ſo Alfonſus a King had his ſymboll; (a Type of his true loue) a Pellican with her bill pricking her breſt, feeding her young with her bloud, with this inſcription, pro lege &amp; pro grege; declaring Emblematically, That Kings with continuall cares waſt their liues to prouide for their Alijs micans meipſum conſumo, alios alens meipſu perdo: aliud eſt eſſe in lege aliud ſublege: qui eſt in lege ſecundum legem agit qui ſub lege ſecundum legem agitur, ille liber eſt, iſte ſeruꝰ: Aug in Pſa. peoples welfares: For good Kings will ſay with Hadrianus Caeſar, Sic ſe geſturum principatum, vt ſciant rem populi eſſe, non ſuam; They will ſo gouerne that all men may ſee they aime more at the publicke good, then any priuate gaine.

                        ew of the Common-wealth, without which, King, nor Kingdome cannot ſtand: And therefore our Sauiour firſt by Chriſt paid Tribute to Tyberius Caeſar. Mat. 17. 27 Si cenſum filius dei ſoluit, tu quis tantus es, qui non putas eſſe ſoluendum? Ambroſius. preſident paid Tribute, and alſo by precept, reſoluing the Diſciples of the Phariſes, demanding, whether it was lawfull to giue Tribute vnto Caeſar, or no? told them peremptorily, Math. 22. 21 That they muſt giue vnto Caeſar that which was Caeſars: Reddendum eſt tributum, honor &amp; obedientia in omnibus, quae non pugnant cum verbo Dei, ſaith Piſcator,
                        
vpon that place; Tribute Honour, and Obedience, is to be giuen vnto the Magiſtrate in all things, not repugnant Reddenda eſſe Caeſari, quae ſua ſunt, illa ſolum dici, non debita, quae pietati ac religioni nihil officiunt: Chryſán c. 22 Mat. Hom. 71 to the word of God: for this cauſe (ſaith Rom. 13. 4. 6 Saint Paul) ye pay Tribute, becauſe the King is the Miniſter of God for thy wealth, applying themſelues for the ſame thing: Cuſtodit te Princeps (ſaith In Lucam: c. 20 
                        Theophylact) ab Hoſtibus, debes itaquè ei tributum: The Prince keeps thee ſafe from enemies, thou doeſt owe him therefore Tribute; and as he ſpeakes ſtill in that place, Nummum ipſum quem habes ab ipſo habes, The money which thou haſt, thou haſt from him, and therfore, Verbo reddendi, Significat debitum quod inexcuſabile ſubditis impoſitum eſt: Theophyl, in 13 Rom. v. 7 
                        Non date, ſed reddite, Not giue, but pay; not a gift, but a debt, which all Subiects owe to him. Non damus ſed reddimus, quiequid ex officio cuiquam damus, ſaith Beucer; We doe not giue, but pay that which of duty we owe: Tributes, Subſidies, and Taskes, &amp;c: are not gifts, but debts, which of neceſſity they muſt and ought to pay. Hoc Scripturae approbant, hoc leges ciuiles communi gentium omnium conſenſu recipiunt (ſaith Hip. in Rom. 13 
                        Hiperius): This doe the Scriptures allow of, (writing there of the payment of Tributes) this doe the Ciuill Lawes, with the common conſent of all Natious accept, and approue: Ius pendendi vectigalia apud omnes gentes fuit ſemper receptiſſimum (ſaith the ſame In Rom. 13. 6 
                        Hiperius) The Law and right of paying Tribute, among all Nations hath euer beene accuſtomed: for how could Kings maintaine their States, defend their Countries, reward their faithfull ſeruants, vndergoe ſo manifold expences, which belong to a regall reckoning, vnleſſe their Subiects with Tributes, Taxes, and Subſidies, helpe to ſuſtaine the common charge? And therefore Calu. in inſtit. lib. 4. c. 20 
                        Caluin writes well, that Tributes and Taxes are the lawfull reuenewes of Princes; which ſerue to maintaine their royalty, and the Common-wealths tranquility: Tributa neceſſaria ſunt reip: ſine eis, nec quies, nec arma, haberi poſſunt, (ſaith Tacitus) 
                        Tacit. lib. 4 Hiſt. Tributes are ſo neceſſary for the Common-wealth, that neither peace, nor warre, nor weapons, can be without them: for warre cannot be maintained without men, nor men without money, which is Neruus belli, The ſinew of warre; Tributis &amp; vectigalibus nulla reſp: aut imperium nedum magnum carere

poteſt, (ſaith the ſame Tac. lib. 13: Annal. 
                        Tacitus) No Countrey, or Kingdome, be it neuer ſo great, can lacke the payment of Tributes, &amp;c. In regnis bene conſtitutis certum conſtitutum eſt, Tributum (ſaith Herodotus 
                        Herod. lib 3 Hiſtor.) In wel gouerned Kingdomes, there is certaine Tribute to be paid. Luke 2. 1 
                        Auguſtus Caeſar taxed all the World, that is, all the Regions and Prouinces then ſubiect to the Romaines, (as the learned interpret it); and this was as Caluin notes, Annuum Tributum, 
                        Piſcator in locum: Caluin: Harm. in locum. 
                        ſed non quotannis fiebat deſcriptio; A yeerly Tribute, though not euery yeere put in wrighting: And the Iewes (though at firſt) they did aegre ferre mentionem diſcriptionis, Hardly away with this yeerely taxing, Non tamen reluctatos eſſe pertinaciter, as Ioſeph: antiq. Iudaic: lib. 18. c. 1. Suaſu pontificis Ioazari cenſeri ſe paſſos eſſe. Joſephus. 
                        Ioſephus writes, They did not obſtinately reſiſt it, but by the perſwaſion of their High Prieſt, they ſuffered themſelues to be taxed. Salomon could not haue beene ſo rich if his people had not payed him Tribute; but the weight of gold 2 Chro 9. 13. 24 Dauid ouer the Tribute ſet Adoram. 2 Sam: 20. 24 Salomon ouer the Tribute placed Adoniram: 1 K 4. 6 they brought to Salomon, in one yeere was ſixe hundreth threeſcore and ſixe Talents of Gold. This duty of paying Tribute, Subſidies, and Taxes, &amp;c: by the ſubiects to the Soueraigne, is by the law of God, and lawes of men, and common cuſtomes of moſt Nations commanded and approued, and that for foure principall cauſes.
                     Firſt to maintaine that royall eſtate which God hath giuen to Kings: the glorious patternes of Kings magnificence, may be fully ſeene in royall Salomon: Looke but vpon There was not the like made in any Kingdome: Imperij finis eſt populi vtilitas, &amp; tranquillitas
                         his Throne, 2 Chro. 9. 17, and you may iudge of all the reſt of his royalty.
                     Secondly, To defend the Common-wealth, both in peace and in warre, which requires a great Treaſury. A great Bird had need of a great neaſt: That High Head which cares for all the politicke body, and night and day ſtudies to preſerue their welfare, muſt participate of their wealth, without which the publike peace and ſecurity cannot be effected: for it is, Status inſolidus qui earet ſolidis.
                     
                     Thirdly To conteſtate and acknowledge their homage and ſubiection to their Soueraigne: for Tributum dare, eſt imperatori ſubiici, &amp; ſignum ſeruitutis, ſay the Canoniſts,

                        Extra: de exact: &amp; cenſ. c. 5, &amp; quaeſt. 8. can.

Looke vpon the Iſraelites (when King Saul was dead) comming to elect and annoynt Dauid in Hebron, to be King ouer Iſrael, 
                        1 Chro. 11. 1 Tuitione non fruitione. Tributum vocant Turcae populi ſanguinem: Poſtel. li. 5 de reb. Turci. Behold we are thy bones and thy fleſh, meaning (as I take it) that their liues and all, were at his ſeruice and commandement: for Tribute is not onely of money, but Sudor &amp; ſanguis populi, The ſweat and blood of the people, if ſuch need require to defend their King and Countrey, is a Tribute due from them, willing and ready to aduenture their liues and limbes, to giue repulſe and reſiſtance to forraine or domeſticall violence.
                     Fourthly, To teſtifie their gratefull affections to their gracious Princes, in thankefulneſſe for the great benefits by their prudent, prouident, and politicke gouernement, reaped and receiued. So Dauid in lamenting Sauls death, remembers the benefits his ſubiects receiued by him in his life time, 2 Sam. 1. 14 Ye Daughters of Iſrael weepe for Saul, which cloathed you in ſcarlet with pleaſures, and hanged ornaments of gold vpon your apparell: So Lament. 4. 20 
                        Ieremy of the good King Ioſiah, lamenting his death, The breath of our noſtrels, the Annoynted of the Lord, was taken in their nets, of whom we ſaid, Vnder his ſhadow we ſhall be preſerued among the Heathen. A good King, brings many bleſſings &amp; benefits vnto his people; and therefore when ſuch as are in authority, be righteous, the people reioyce, ſaith Prou. 29. 2

                        4. A King by iudgement maintaines the countrey, By a man of vnderſtanding and knowledge, a Realme endureth long, ſaith the ſame Pro. 28. 2 
                        Salomon; yea, (as wiſe Plato well ſaid) Beatas fore reſp: cum aut Philoſophentur reges; aut regnent Philoſophi: When as Kings were Philoſophers, or Philoſophers Kings, then ſuch Common-wealths ſhould be happy. And indeed all earthly happineſſe which is deriued to the members, proceeds from the Head, (next vnder God, the primary Author of all good things) by whoſe

direction, diſcretion, circumſpection, care, counſell, and continuall vigilancy, they are preſerued in peace, and proſper in plenty: for there are ſixe externall earthly helpes, neceſſary for the temporall proſperity of any Kingdome. 1. A King to rule. 2. A Law to iudge, 3. Pollicy to guide, 4. People to inhabite, 5. Power to defend, 6: Riches to maintaine it, and which is the Alpha and Omega of all, and aboue all, and before all, the Lord and King of all, to proſper and preſerue all, without whoſe protection theſe muſt come to ruine all. Pſa. 127. 1 Except the Lord keepe the City, the keeper watcheth but in vaine; Except the Lord gouerne and guide the ſhippe of State, it runnes vpon the rocke: Therefore Prince and people ought duly to ſay with the Pſal. 44. 4, 5 
                        Pſalmiſt; Thou art our King, O God, ſend helpe vnto Iacob, Through thee haue wee thruſt backe our enemies, through thee haue wee trodden downe them that roſe vp againſt vs, &amp;c. Riſe vp for our ſuccour, and redeeme vs for 26. thy mercies ſake. Well, Tributes, Subſidies, Taxes, &amp;c: are a good meanes to help to ſupport the ſtate of Kingdomes; and as they bee the publike Tribute of the Common-wealths, ſo ſhould they bee imployed about the publike tranquility. Let no Theudas herein deceiue you, or any Iudas of Galile (who in the dayes of the Tribute, drew away much people, as Acts 5. 37 
                        Gamaliel ſpeakes) delude you; for he periſhed, and all that obeyed him: Si quis putat non eſſe vectigal ſoluendum, aut tributum aut honorem exhibendum, in magno errore labitur, ſaith Aug. in lib. ad Rom. propoſit. 72

                        Aretius; We owe them by right, if wee doe not pay them, wee offend againſt the rule of Iuſtice: Nay to pay them is ſo neceſſary for all, (as the ſame Aretius there) Niſivelint fortunis, &amp; bonis, adeo

loue, and loyalty. But herein may ariſe a queſtion; The

                         Laity ought to pay Tribute to their Soueraigne Kings, but whether the Clergy? And the chiefe pillars of Popery haue already paſſed their verdict, that they ought not to pay Tribute; and he that was then foreman of the grand Iury, I meane Boniface the 8, came not forth with an Ignoramus, but with a Definitiue Decreuimus Decreeing, that no Clergy man ſhould pay tribute: And ſince a late Iury of Popiſh Doctors, that haue beene empannelled vpon that caſe, haue paſſed their verdicts, that Clergy men are exempted, not onely from Tributes, but alſo from all trials, or puniſhments, to be inflicted by ſecular Courts. So Bar. in paraeneſi: ad Venetos: pag. 47 
                        Baronius in his Paraeneſis to the Venetians writes, Senatum venetum contra ſacerdotes vel enormiſſime delinquentes, nullam habere iuriſdictionem, quia ſcriptum eſt, Tu quis es qui indic as alienum ſeruum? &amp;c. The Senate of 
                           Ʋenice hath no iuriſdiction againſt Prieſts, neuer ſo fouly offending, becauſe it is written, What art thou that iudgeſt another mans ſeruant? he ſtands to his Maſter, or fals; and the Venetians doing contrary, he compares to be Inſtar monſtri, &amp; portenti Luciferi, Like that monſtrous portent of pride, Lucifer. Know ye not that we ſhall iudge the Angels? So Baronius; So De clerici: c. 28 
                        Bellarmine, ſing the ſame ſong, that Churchmen that are borne, and inhabite in ſoueraigne Princes Countries, are notwithſtanding not their Subiects, and cannot be iudged by them, although they may iudge them: And againe, that the obedience, which Churchmen giue to Princes, euen in the meaneſt and meere temporall Ibidem. things, is not by any neceſſary ſubiection, but onely out of diſcretion, and for obſeruation of good order and cuſtome: Theſe two Cardinals, like Sampſon, ſweate in the Philiſtians mill, to grinde to powder the power of Princes ouer the Clergy; thereby the more to aduance the, vſurped might of the Papall Miter. What ſhould I record the paltry verdicts of others, who liue vpon Bellarmines &amp; Baronius ſcraps and fragments, as the Poets did vpon Homers Baſon? and will wright and fight, yea

                        Artaxerxes commiſſion giuen to Eſdras, in which it pleaſed the King to command, that no Tribute or taxe of the Prieſts, Leuites, holy Singers, Porters, Miniſters of the Temple, or workemen of the Temple ſhould be taken, or any had power to taxe them in any thing; the anſwere is eaſie. Firſt, this immunity proceeded, ex mera gratia &amp; beneplacito, from the meere fauour and pleaſure of the King, the better to incourage them in their worke at Ieruſalem. Secondly, they poſſeſſed no lands, but liued by oblations and ſacrifices; being herein like the Druides among the Frenchmen (who payed no Tribute) as Caeſar writes; the reaſon was, becauſe they had nothing, and where nothing is, the King loſes his right. Thirdly, a particular fauour or example makes not a generall law: Indeed Cod. tit. de Clericis: &amp; in alys tit: legis. 
                        Iustinian the Emperor hath granted to the Cleargy ſpeciall priuiledges, and freed them from military

or martiall imployments, perſonall officers, and from many exactions; but all this proceeds ex beneplacito, out of an Emperiall fauour, and royall grace, which all vertuous Kings beare vnto Gods Miniſters, non ex praecepto, or praxi; for practiſe Math, 17. 27. 
                        Christ himſelfe payed Tribute for himſelfe and Peter; and by Math, 22. 21. precept, Giue vnto Caeſar that which is Caeſars: telling his Diſciples, Math, 20. 25. The Lords of the Gentils had dominion ouer them: And S. Rom, 13: 6. 7. 
                        Paul commands euery ſoule to be ſubiect to the higher Powers, to pay Tribute, and to giue Tribute to whom they owe Tribute. To them therefore that challenge immunity from the performance of theſe publicke debts of tributarie duties to their Liege Lords and Kings, I may ſay to them as Diocleſian to the Philoſopher; Thy profeſſion differs from thy petition, thy profeſſion teaches thee to giue Caeſar his due, and not to rob him of his right. Biſhop Latimer calls ſuch theeues that rob the King of his due debt, Subſidies, Tributes, or Taxes. Rather imitate that Ambroſ. contra Auxen: 11. quaeſt: 1, Can: ſi tributum. 
                        Ambroſe the famous Biſhop of Millan, who teacheth thee a better leſſon: Si tributum petit Imperator, non negamus, agri Eccleſiae ſoluant tributum; ſi agros deſiderat Imperator, poteſtatem habet vendicandorum, tollat eos ſi libitum est; Imperatori non dono, ſed non nego; If the Emperor demand Tribute, we doe not denie it, your fields of our Church ſhall pay tribute; If the Emperor demand the fields, he hath power to challenge them, let him take them, I neither giue them nor denie them in no caſe, arguing obedience in ordinary, or extraordinary exactions: agreeing fully with Luther, 
                        Luth: in Math: 22, 21. If thy ſubſtance, bodie, or life ſhould be taken from thee by the Magiſtrate, thou maiſt ſay thus, I doe willingly yeeld them vnto you, and acknowledge you for ruler ouer me, I will obey you, but whether you vſe your power and authority well or ill, ſee you to that: For Kings muſt one day giue account of all their workes, to the King of Kings; and if they haue abuſed their power by Tyrannie, crueltie, or any bad gouernment, an hard iudgement Wiſd. 6. 5. 8. ſhall ſuch haue that beare ſuch rule, for then abides the ſorer triall, as the Sonne of wiſedome ſpeakes; The power is from God, the abuſe of

it from themſelues, and they will finde it, when God and it cals them to reckon. The chaine of gould is not made the worſe becauſe an harlot weares it about her necke: it is Luth: in Math. 22. 21. 
                        Luthers compariſon in this caſe; ſo ſtill Kings muſt be obeyed, for conſcience ſake, if not commanding contrary to Gods commandements.

In olde time ſcarce any treaſon without a Prieſt, in our time ſcarce any without a Ieſuite: As Iudas was the anteſignanus of traytors (chiefe Captain of the curſed crue) ſo ſince him the falſe ſtiled Ieſuits, but the true Iudaites, are the cheefe Shibas, to blow aloud the trumpet of rebellion. And there was a wicked man named Sheba, the ſonne of Bicri, a man of Iemini and hee blew the Trumpet and ſaid, We haue no part in Dauid, nor inheritance in the ſonne of Iſhai. Euery man to his tents O Iſrael, 2 Sam. 20. 1. And there are many of Iſrael that follow theſe Shebas, but 2 Sam. 20. 2. the men of Iudah claue faſt vnto their King, from Iordan euen to Ieruſalem. All good ſubiects will cleaue with the men of Iudah faithfully to their King, and will goe with Ioab to purſue theſe Shebas, 
                        13. 22. vntill their heads be cut off and throwne to them ouer the wall. Theſe Shebas make Kings the markes of their murther; ſaying with treacherous 2 Sam. 17. 2.

                        1 Kings 22. 31. Fight neyther againſt ſmall or great, ſaue onely againſt the King of Iſrael. Feriunt ſummos fulmina montes. The higheſt mountaines moſt expoſed to Thunders: And to perpetrate ſuch crying and capitall murders, they will hazard the perill of their liues, and loſſe of their ſoules: and (but Pſal. 91. 11. that the Lord hath giuen his Angels a charge ouer his Anointed to keepe them in all his waies) the attempts of ſuch deſperate miſcreants were deadly dangerous: for as Seneca, Ʋitae tuae dominus eſt, quiſquis ſuam contempſit, He is Maſter

of thy life, who contemnes his owne. Cato when hee had got a ſword, (though therewith to kill himſelfe) cried out, Now am I my owne man. So theſe deſperate villaines who runne with deſire to their owne deaths, are their owne men to act murder: but God doth bring to nought their deſires and deuices, and raiſeth vp for his ſeruants in extraordinary dangers, extraordinary deliuerances. The Herodotas. imminent danger of King Croeſus, yet a Heathen King, opened the mouth of his dumbe ſonne to tell it. Plutarch. 
                        Beſſus his parricide diſcouered by the chattering of Swallowes; verifying Salomons 
                        Eccl. 10. 20. wordes, The fowles of the ayre carrie that voice; God can cauſe euery fowle of heauen, and euery creature on earth to finde a tongue to tell treaſon, to deliuer his Anointed. Our gracious King is a ſpeaking mappe of many wonderfull deliuerances in extraordinary dangers; ſtill we cry and craue with Dauid, 
                        Pſal. 20. 9. 
                        Domine ſaluum fae Regem, Lord ſaue the King, cloath Pſal. 132. 18. Pſal. 2. 9. all his enemies with ſhame, and breake them in peeces like a Potters veſſell: Let thy hands O Lord, finde out all that hate him; make them like a fiery ouen in the time of thine anger, and Pſalm 21. 9. deſtroy them in thy wrath: Deliuer his ſoule from the Pſalm 22. 20. 21. ſword, and ſaue him from the Lions mouthes: confound all Shebas that would ſtirre vp Iſrael againſt Dauid, and all Adoniahs that gape to take the kingdome from our Salomon; all like them, let them periſh like them. Then will all loyall ſubiects reioyce when they ſee the vengeance, they ſhall waſh their feet in the bloud of the wicked. Let our feruent prayers be daily powred forth vnto God, to defend him from all Traytors, to reueale their plots and reuenge their purpoſes, that they

That they who would kill a King, may neuer haue power to performe it: that no danger may aſſault him, no treachery may endanger him, giue thine Angels charge O Lord to ſentinell ouer him: make his chamber like the tower of Cant. 4. 4. 
                        Dauid, built for defence; a thouſand ſhields hang therein, and all the targets of the ſtrong men; and his bed Cant. 3. 7, 8. like Salomons, threeſcore ſtrong men round about it

of the valiant men of Iſrael, they all handle the ſword, and are expert in warre; euery one hath his ſword vpon his thigh, for the feare by night, that ſo no enemy may oppreſſe him, nor the wicked approach to hurt him; to deſtroy his foes before his face, and plague them that hate Pſal. 89. 22. 23. him; his ſeed long to endure, and his daies as the daies of heauen. So ſhall the Lord be gracious to his Seruant, and mercifull to vs his people who continually pray, God ſaue the King, Corporally.

                           GOD Saue the King Spiritually, God euer keep him conſtant and couragious to maintaine the true profeſſion of the Goſpell, and to labour to purge Gods Church of all ſuperſtition, and to plant in it Gods true religion. Our Kings owne ſaying, viz.
                     
                     This is the firſt duety of Kingly ſeruice vnto God, to cleanſe his Church of all idolatry and ſuperſtition. It is the chiefe duty of King to ſettle firſt Gods ſeruice and Church affaires before their own.
                     
                     The good Kings Ezechias and Ioſias, were carefull in this behalfe: Ezechiah when hee came to the Crowne of Iudah, 
                        2 Kings 18. 4. he tooke away the high places, brake the Images, and cut downe the groues, and brake in peeces the brazen ſerpent, &amp;c. that is, rooted and raced out all Idolatry. So 2 Kings 23. 
                        Ioſiah puts downe all Idols, and Idolatrous Prieſts, who defiled the Temple. So 1 Kin. 15. 12. 13. 
                        Aſa tooke the wicked Sodomites out of the land, and depoſed Maacha his Mother, becauſe ſhee had made an Idoll in a groue. So 1 Kings 6. 2. 
                        Salomon inſtalled in his kingdome, built a Temple for ſeruice and worſhip of the Lord. It is the office of a King ſpecially to take care to prouide, that God may be religiouſlie worſhipped, that his 1 Sam, 12. 24. people may feare the Lord, &amp; ſerue him in the trueth: for the happineſſe of King and Kingdome conſiſts in the trueth of their religion; For that nation and kingdome which will not ſerue the Lord ſhall periſh and be vtterly deſtroyed, ſaith the Prophet Eſay 60. 12. 
                        Eſay.
                        
                           Eſt boni Principis religionem ante omnia conſtituere;
                        
                        
ſaith Liut: decad. 1. l. 1. 
                        Liuie, It is the part of a good King, firſt to eſtabliſh true religion; for that is the very fountaine and foundation of all felicity. Plutarch. de ciu: adminiſtr. 
                        Beneficentia quae fit in cultum Dei maxima gratia. That loue and care which is declared towards the true worſhip of God, is moſt commendable: for true religion is Cardo or Axis, the very Pillar of all proſperity, the ſoule of Tranquility, the totall ſumme of true felicity: Propter Eccleſiam in mundo, durat mundus, ſaith Luther, Chriſts Church on earth is the cauſe of the continuance of this earthly world: without the light of the Goſpel, Kings &amp; people liue in thraldome, in the Egypt of wofull blindneſſe: it is but painted happineſſe, a vaine flouriſh, nay a dangerous ſhip of ſtate, where God ſits not at the ſterne. As all kingdomes ſtand luteis pedibus, vpon clay feet: ſo that Kingdome cannot ſtand at all, which wants the foundation, true religion. It is the ſpeech of an Plato lib. 4. de legibus. Heathen, but may be the leſſon of a Chriſtian, Religio vera eſt firmamentum reip. &amp;c. True religion the foundation of a Common wealth, and the chiefe care ought to be, to plant the ſame. So 1 Chr. 15. 
                        Dauid reioyces in nothing ſo much as in the Arke of God, deſirous rather to be a dore-keeper in Gods houſe, then to rule in the tents of the vngodly. Like to that good Emperor, who gloried more to be membrum Eccleſiae, then caput Imperij, a member of Gods Church, then an head of a great Empire. Salomon 
                        2 Ch. 2. 1. begins well, firſt in building an houſe for God, knowing nothing can proſper without God: Except the 
                        Pſalm. 127. 1. Pſalme 2. 4. 10 
                        Lord keep the City, the watchman watcheth but in vaine. In vaine doe the Kings of the earth ſtand vp, if they aſſemble againſt the Lord, for then hee laughes them to ſcorne, and ſhall haue them in deriſion. Be wiſe now therefore 
                        11 
                        O ye Kings, ſerue the Lord in feare, be wiſe in Diuine matters, ſerue the Lord in feare; for his feare is the beginning of wiſedome, to direct you to rule your ſelues and people in the ſeruice and worſhip of his holy name.
                     We read it recorded of Gregor: Naziāz: orat. funebr; in laudem Athanaſij. 
                        Conſtantinus the Emperor, that when he died, he did much lament for three things which had happened in his reigne. Firſt, the murther of Gallus his kinſman: Secondly, the liberty of Iulian the Apoſtate:

Thirdly, the change and alteration of religion. And ſurely there cannot be a greater cauſe of lamentation, then an innouation or alteration of religion: yea then a tolleration of a contrary religion. It had beene a hard matter to haue had obtained a tolleration of ſuch a thing as a Maſſe at Moſes hands with a maſſe of money. A godly Prince may not ſuffer any religion but the true religion in his Dominions, and this we may proue by diuers reaſons. Firſt the exerciſe of a falſe religion is directly againſt the honour and glory of God. Ergo. Secondly, conſent in true religion is vinculum Eccleſiae, the chayne and bond of Gods Church; for Eph. 45. there is but one faith: therefore a difference and diſſention in religion, is a diſſolution in Gods Church; but no Prince ought to haue his hand in diſſoluing Gods Church, for Kings are Eſay. 49. Oportet Principem eſſe ante omnia Deicolam. nurſing Fathers of the Church. Thirdly, it is the Princes duty to prouide for the ſafety of the bodies, much more for the ſafety of the ſoules of his Subiects. Now true religion is the foode, but falſe the bane of ſoules; and you know, Qui non ſeruat periturum, cum poteſt, occidit, He that doth not helpe one ready to periſh, being able to helpe, kills him. Fourthly, the Reuel. 2. 14. 15. Angell of the Church of Pergamus is reprooued for hauing ſuch in Pergamus as maintained the doctrine of Balaam, and the doctrine of the Nicholaitans; and the Church of Reuel. 2. 20. 
                        Thiatyra reproued for ſuffering Iezabel to teach and deceiue. Fiftly, the Lords Iudg. 6. 25. 26. Altar and Baals Altar muſt not ſtand together: Quae concordia Dei &amp; Belial? No agreement twixt God and Belial. Indeed the Papiſts haue beene very earneſt to ſupplicate for a Tolleration for their corrupt religion, and yet themſelues neuer allow it. The Pope neuer afforded ſuch fauour to Proteſtants, witneſſe their Inquiſition: Nay De laicis, lib. 3. c. 19. &amp;c. 21. 
                        Bellarmine doth confeſſe, that the Papiſts would not ſuffer any among them, Qui oſtendunt vllo ſigno etiam externo ſe fauere Lutheranis, Who doe declare by any ſigne externall that they fauour the Lutherans; but they doe mittere illos mature in locum ſuum, ſend ſuch quickly to their laſt home. Read but Lencaeus the Louayne profeſſor c. 21. §. 2. in his booke Devnica religione, or Pamelius in his book

                        De diuerſis religionibus non admittendis, Who both with might and maine diſpute againſt Tollerations. It was a great commendation in the Emperour Conſtantino, who would not ſuffer Idolatry in any part of his Dominions, as Euſeb. lib. 4. de vit: Conſt. 
                        Euſebius writes of him. And it was commendable in Amphilochius 
                        Trip: hiſt: l. 5. c 25 Vid. Theod: lib: 5. c. 16. a Biſhop, who reproued Theodoſius the Emperor, that he ſo long winked at Arrius, and ſuffered him to ſpread his peſtilent hereſie ouer the body of the Church; and it was commended in the Emperor, who was not angry with the words of iuſt reproofe, but forthwith baniſhed Arrius, &amp; gaue him ſome part of his iuſt deſerts. Sozom. lib. 7. c: 12. But heerein we neede not ſeeke out forraine hiſtories, wee haue examples at home, who neuer would yeeld to tollerate corrupt religion. Edward the ſixth, a Prince moſt famous and vertuous, was ſollicited by Carolus the Emperour, 
                           Mr. Foxe in Acts &amp; Monuments. and his owne Counſellors, to permit the Lady Mary to haue Maſſe in her owne houſe; his reſolution negatiue, ſaying, he would ſpend his life, and all that he had rather then to agree and grant to that hee knew certainely to be againſt the truth.
                     The late Queene Elizabeth (of bleſſed memory) could 
                           Dr. Abbot in his anſwer to the reaſon vi. of Dr. Hill in the latter end. neuer be perſwaded to tollerate Popiſh Religion, who after innumerable dangers and manifold perſecutions, with vnſpeakeable courage, notwithſtanding many difficulties at home, of Princes abroad, and of the Diuell euerwhere, profeſſed to maintaine the truth of the Goſpell, and to deface Idolatry and ſuperſtition, which with ſingular conſtancy ſhee continued all the dayes of her life. And now this our great &amp; gracious Soueraigne followes the ſteps of thoſe religious Princes, not all the World can change his conſtant reſolution in Chriſtian Religion, his eares and hearts abhorre their charmes, who are Petitioners in this kind; for the granting of ſuch a requeſt, might much diſquiet the Chriſtian Church, State, and Goſpell. God euer keepe and bleſſe the King, in this his holy and ſpirituall perſeuerance in the truth of the Goſpell; make his heart like Mount Sion, neuer to be remoued: A King ſo conſtant in profeſſion of the Goſpell, and ſo learned and profound

in all ſpirituall knowledge, that he is able to confute, and conuince with ſound arguments the enemies, of the Goſpell: and thereupon it was (as I take it) that Suarez the Ieſuit ſaid; That Learning did diſparage the royall dignity, becauſe the Champions of Rome ſee that they are not able to incounter with his Highnes matchleſſe knowledge. And ſurely if learning grace any man, it muſt be more gracious O faelicia antiquorum tempora, in quibus ipſi imperatores mundum regentes, ſeipſos philoſophiae dederunt, vt de Alexandro, de Julio Caeſare, de Ptolomaeo rege &amp;c: Hug. in dicaſc lib. 2. in a Monarch, a Man of Men.

                        Salomon did, I the Preacher haue beene King in Ieruſalem; but for the Prieſt to climbe into the Kings throne, is to play the Popes part, the part of Antichriſt. Our royall Soueraigne hath made it his laſt delight, to delight in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth hee meditate Pſa. 1. 2. day and night: In which ſpiritual labour, hee hath ſo profited himſelfe and others, that hee hath taken Princely paines to publiſh the truth of Chriſt; and to proclaime to the Potentates of the world the errors of Antichriſt: So that all people haue cauſe to pray, God ſaue the King ſpiritually.
                        
That a Pro. 16. 10 diuine ſentence may be in the lips of the King, and his mouth ſhall not tranſgreſſe in iudgement, who like the good Emperour Conſtantine, labours to decide matters of Religion, by the true rule of Gods word: for ſo Theod: Hiſt lib 1 c. 7. 
                        Conſtantine commanded the Biſhops to order all points by the Booke of God, which Booke he placed for the ſame purpoſe in the middeſt of them: And euen ſo ſpeaks our dread Soueraign, In his Apology for the Oath of Alleagiance, pa. 36, line 13. whatſoeuer I find agree with the Scriptures, I will gladly imbrace; what is otherwiſe, I wil with their reuerēce reiect; godly &amp; golden words. The Lord euermore bleſſe his body and ſoule ſpiritually, and enlarge the great Talent of his Princely wiſdome, giuing him as great a meaſure of knowledge, as was giuen to Salomon 
                        2 Chr. 1. 12; yea, ſuch riches, treaſures, and honours, as none had before him, or after him; and as his Maieſty hath taken manifold paines to reduce the Popiſh Sectaries, out of their ſpirituall blindneſſe, that they who will not bee wakened out of their ſlumbers of ignorance, by the voice of ſo royall and religious a ſheapheard, may be compelled by the Sword of Magiſtracy to depart out of Babylon, or out of his Dominion: But herein it becomes not me to giue counſell; rather fall to prayer, that the Lord, whoſe cauſe it is, would take the cauſe into his owne hand, and ſtirre vp the hearts and hands of all Chriſtian Kings, to compell all people, who will not be moued by the word of Gods Miniſtery to come out of Babylon, might be forced by the ſword of Magiſtracy Reu. 18. 4 to depart from her, leaſt they receiue of her plagues.

The admirable peace, plenty, and proſperity, by a Chriſtian, and politicall gouernement his Highneſſe People doe enioy, hath made other Nations enuie our felicity: The French haue ſworn, that this Land (in reſpect of peace and plenty long continued) was the Land of Promiſe, and their Kings hitherto haue had Moſes puniſhment, to ſtand vpon their Towers, (as Deut. 34. 1 he vpon Mount Nebo) to ſee the clifts of this Canaan, but not permitted to enter; that we ſee that verified, which Salomon long agoe deliuered, Pro. 29. 4 A King by iudgement, maintaines the Country: or with wiſdome Wiſ. 6. 24 her ſelfe; A wiſe King is the ſtay of the People: or to ſpeake of our Soueraigne in the words of the Princely Pſa. 79. 70. 72 Prophet, The Lord choſe Dauid his ſeruant, &amp;c: to feed his People in Iacob, and his inheritance in Iſrael; ſo hee fed them according to the ſimplicity of his heart, and guided them by the diſcretion of his hands.

How happy was the Throne of Gouernement, how ſucceſſefully Religion propagated, when vertue honouring Conſtantine was inthroned.

                        Euſebius the Biſhop of Caeſarea thought himſelfe much honoured, that he was appointed to preach at the inauguration of Conſtantinus the Emperour: ſo I take it as my great ioy, that I (the moſt weake of all our tribe) am one of the firſt in this kinde to write the aniuerſary of Englands happineſſe by your Maieſties entrance, to put them in a perpetuall remembrance, to reioyce with thankefulneſſe. And if I ſhould remember in your preſence the innumerable benefits and bleſſings your ſubiects of great Brittaine enioy by your Princely comming to this Crowne, I might be iudged a flatterer (a creature moſt odious in your Graces eyes,) modeſty compels me to be ſilent. I will onely ſay that which I haue read the Painter Zeuxes did, who being to make the portraiture of Iuno, choſe out certaine amiable Virgins, &amp; put the ſeuerall beauty of them all into that picture: ſo indeed the wiſe Creator of all, hath made you ſuch a King, the liuing picture of all earthly perfections; and as it was an old ſaying, That in one Auſten there was many Doctors, in one Iulius Caeſar many Captaines; ſo in one and our King Iames, many Kings, the very perfection of moſt Kings.
                     But I will turne our praiſes into prayers; remembring Antaloides ſaying to a certaine Orator making a long oration of Hercules praiſes, cut him off thus, Quis eum vnquam

ſanus vituperauerit? VVho euer in his right wits diſcommended him? So, who dare, nay who can, (except the ſeed of the ſerpent) diſpraiſe your Highneſſe, whoſe vertues finde fauour with God and men? euery tongue pronounces your name with ioy, and euery heart affects your Maieſty with content and comfort. As God hath giuen you power in hand, ſo haue you pittie in heart, Clementia Regis eſt quaſi imber ſerotinus, ſaith

So that I may ſay to your Grace as Mecaenas ſaide of Octauius Caeſar, Omnes te tanquam parentem &amp; ſeruatorem ſuum intuentur, te moderatum, vita inculpata, &amp; pacificum amant, &amp;c. All people fixe their dutifull eyes vpon you, as vpon the publike Father of the Common-wealth, loyally louing you, being milde and mercifull, holy in life, and peaceable in gouernment.

And conſider with your ſelues the happy bleſſings you enioy by the mercifull prouidence of God, in giuing to this Realme ſo godly and gracious a Soueraigne to reigne ouer you; and it will make you cry forth with the Pſa. 3. 8.

Yea the wiſe Moraliſt, vnchriſtened Seneca could ſay, Nobilitas animi, generoſitas eſt ſenſus, nobilitas hominis eſt generoſus animus: The which true Nobility of the minde is your inherent, and hereditary honor, famouſed for Piety, Iustice, Learning, and Liberality, ſo that the world ſees you write not your deſires in the duſt. We bleſſe God, and wonder to behold in you ſo admirable a patterne of true Nobility, &amp; moues vs to ſay with K. Lemuel,

                     Many haue done vertuouſly, but you ſurmount them all, in your great perfection of Arts, and happy progreſſe in Grace, the world can number but few ſuch. Vereor ne violem frontem tuā, ſedem honoris, teſtem verecundiae: I know the ſound of the trumpet of your praiſes is no muſick to your eares, neyther doe I loue ſuch ſtraines: the land in generall ecchoes your renowned applauſe, and God who hath ſo bleſſed you, and by the Kings Maieſty promoted you to ſo honourable a Place, continue you an happy inſtrument of much good to Church and Common-wealth, and proſper your noble proceedings according to the promiſe of your admired entrance. And now (moſt honorable Lord) I humblie craue your pardon, in preſuming to preſent ſo ſimple a Preſent, vnto the view of ſo approued a iudgement, who haue Mercurium in lingua, &amp; Mineruā pectore: yet although not the manner (being meane and homely) yet the matter handled may iuſtly merit your noble acceptance, being a deſcription of the hainous ſin of Treaſon, the fall and Tragedy of Traitors (plagues which the Arch-traitor to mankinde hath added to the world;) and alſo a ſeaſonable ſubiect for the Time, Auguſt the fift, againſt which day it was, and is prepared as an annuall obiect. And I know there is none within the

compaſſe of Great Brittaine poures forth more hearty prayers to God with a more feruent and faithfull ſoule, then your Honor doth, for the preſeruation of our moſt deare and dread Soueraigne, and for the detection and deſtruction of all peſtilent and truculent Traitors. Wherefore in a hopefull affiance of your honorable acceptance, I humbly offer this little labor, (a Teſtimony of my great obſeruance) with my ſelfe perpetually to your ſeruice, not after a ceremoniall ſubmiſſion, but from a ſerious agnizing and feeling of mine owne imbecillity, euery way ſo obſcure and weake, that ingenuouſlie I confeſſe,

                  And of all others I know your Honors cenſure and iudgement is moſt ſubſtantiall, yet my weakeneſſe thus farre encourages me, that your Honor will like my willing mind, commend the matter, though not the manner; and I hope will fauourablie accept this Mite, and put it into your richer Treaſurie, and countenance it with your worthy protection, which will be like Aiax buckler to ſhield it ſafe againſt detraction.

                        THE memory of Gods great and glorious workes, either of iudgement vpon his enemies, or mercy towards the Church, ought to be preſerued with a thankefull remembrance. So the Eſter 9. Iewes being preſerued by the meanes of Queene Eſter, 
                        17 and godly Mordecai, from the intended plot by Haman, 
                        22 kept the foureteenth day of the moneth Adar, yeerely with feaſting and ioy. So when God had deliuered his

people of Iſrael from the tyranny of Tryphon, by the meanes of Simon their Captaine, he 1 Macch. 13. 52 ordayned that the ſame day of their deliuerance, ſhould be kept euery yeere with gladneſſe. So when the Nehem. 8. 9. 18. people of Iſrael were deliuered from the captiuity of Babylon, and reſtored to Gods true Religion, they kept a Feaſt ſeauen dayes together to the Lord with reioycing and thankſgiuing.
                     The Feaſts Deut. 16. 1. of the Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt, Tabernacles, were commanded by Moſes to be kept holy, in remembrance of great benefits receiued at Gods hands.
                     Hence it was, that in times paſt, the Patriarks, Prophets, and people of God, would not forget any memorable act of Gods prouidence, without ſetting ſome remarkeable Memonto vpon it, that ſo it might remaine freſh to ſucceeding generations; that Pſa. 78. 6. the children vnborne might tell it to their children.
                     That 2 Chr. 20. 26. valley wherein Iehoſhaphats aduerſaries were ouerthrowne, was called Beracah, a valley of bleſſing, that ſo the Name might preſent to their minds to praiſe God for their maruellous victory. Gen. 28. 19. 
                        Iacob did call the place where God appeared to him, Bethel, The Houſe of God, which before was called Luz: and 1 Chr. 13. 11. 
                        Dauid the place where Vzza was ſmitten, Perez. vzza, i. the diuiſion of 
                           Ʋzzah; and Gen. 22. 14. 
                        Abraham the place where Iſaac was deliuered from the bloody knife, Iehouah-ijreh, i.

Alike was the end of that bloudy Tyrant Antiochus, whom 2 Macch. 9. 5. the Lord puniſhed with the paine of the bowels that was remedileſſe, and ſore torments in the inner parts, and all his members bruiſed with a great fall; ſo that wormes came out of the body of this wicked man in aboundance, and 7. 9. his fleſh fell off for paine, and all his army grieued at the ſmell, ſo that no man could beare him becauſe of his ſtink, 10 12 28 no not his owne ſelfe: Thus that murderer ſuffered moſt

grieuouſly, and as he had intreated other men, ſo he died a miſerable death: for with what Math. 7. 2, meaſure men mete, it ſhall be meaſured to them againe.
                     This is ſo cleare a Truth, that murder neuer goes vnpuniſhed on earth, by God or Man, as that diuine &amp; humane hiſtories, &amp; common experience affords pregnant proofes and examples: then how much more will the Lord reuenge the murder of his owne Vicegerents, whom hee hath giuen a generall precept, not 1 Chr. 16. 21. to touch them, no Eccl. 10. 2

                     The puniſhment of diſobedience and treaſon is of two kindes. 1 Puniſhments by God. 2 Puniſhments by man. Puniſhments by God are threefold; externall, internall, eternall.

And as their names be diſgraced, ſo their poſterity depriued of the honour and pedigree, where before their fall they were intereſſed and lineally inueſted: for although Traytors in England, are not vſed as they were in Perſia, that euery one of the Family ſhould be put to death; or as in Macedonia, fiue of the Traytors neareſt Kinſ-folke ſuffer with him; yet are they puniſhed here in name and poſterity, depriued of their lands, liuings, goods, offices, blood, and honour; which is the fourth greefe that might (if it were poſſible) euen vexe a Traytor in his graue, to behold himſelfe to be naked and deſtitute of all the goods of nature, Fame and Fortune, and by his fall to haue deplumed all his Progeny, not onely of Pedigree, but of Patrimony,

Saint Bernard paints Ber. in ſer. quadrageſ. out Ambition in perfect colours, Ambitio ſecretum virus, pestis occulta, doli artifex, mater hypocriſis, liuoris parens, vitiorum origo, tinea ſanctitatis, excaecatrix cordium, exremedijs

                     Ambition liues in euery Climate, and loued of euery Tribe: In the ſtate politicall, the poore man would be a yeoman; the yeoman after the death of his wife, or dearth of corne, would be a gentleman, and will giue armes, if the Herald will accept of Angels: the Squire would bee a Knight; the Knight a Baron, the Baron an Earle, the Earle D.

                        I Might in the next place propound Pride (as chiefe mouer of Treaſon) which as Hugo victorinus lib. 1. de anima. 
                        Hugo writes, rides in a Coach drawen with foure horſes, Ambition, Vaine-glory, Contempt, and Diſobedience; all ready to run the race of Treachery, if the reynes be looſe: Or I might mention Enuy, Diſcontentment of minde vpon ſome inward corruption, or outward vexation, or deſire of reuenge, miſliking the puniſhment or diſgrace of their moſt affected friends, or ſome other ſiniſter cauſes which ſome traitors may harbour in their hearts; and if I had Momus wiſhed window to looke into their breaſts, I might the better diſcouer and diſcourſe of them. But to pretermit theſe and many others which might be alleadged, I will onely inſiſt vpon one (becauſe I will be the larger in it) the very radicall and efficient cauſe of curſed treachery in theſe latter dayes, namely the ſeditious doctrine, or rather Pace bonorū virorum dictum ſit, nouitas iſta, ne dicam haereſis &amp;c.

Rom. pontif. lib. 2, c. 9. p. 131. 
                        Carerius, Papa habet poteſtatem remouendi, reuocandi, corrigendi, &amp; puniendireges, &amp;c: Et hoc tenendum vera fide, tanquam naturalis, moralis, &amp; diuina lex Dei, The Pope hath power to remoue, reuoake,

correct, and puniſh Kings; and this is to be holden with a true beleefe, as the very Naturall, Morall, and Diuine Law of God: and therefore the Ieſuites haue made it an Art. 55. Article, Doe you beleeue that the Pope can put the Queene from her authority? Anſ. I doe beleeue it. From the ſeed of this ſerpentine doctrine, the Doctrine of Deuils it is, That the Pope can excommunicate Kings, depoſe Ab omni debito obedientiae &amp;c. them from their Thrones, free Concil. Trident. ſeſſ. 14. c. 7. Subiects from obedience; and if they doe excidere, fall from them, the next is occidere, to kill them, for deponere a throno, is exponere periculo, to depoſe them from their throne, is to expoſe them to deadly perill; capitis diminutio, to depriue them of their kingdome, is as much as capitis obtruncatio, to cut their throats. Si Paparegem deponat, ab illis tantum poterit expelli, vel interfici quibus ipſe id commiſerit, ſaith the Ieſuite Ieſ. Suarez lib. 6, cap. 4. 
                        Suarez, If the Pope depoſe a King, of them onely hee is to be expelled or killed, to whom the Pope ſhall commit that buſineſſe: and addes after, That if the Pope ſhall declare a King to be an heretike, and fallen from his kingdome, without further declaration touching the execution, then the lawfull ſucceſſor beeing a Catholicke, hath power to doe the feate, or if he refuſe it, it appertaineth to the body of the kingdome. The cruell Cannibals may become prentiſes to theſe Ieſuites, the Maſters to teach rules to murther Kings, the ring; leaders of rebellion, and trumpeters of treaſon, telling and teaching the people, That Subiects are releaſed from the oath of Allegiance giuen to Princes, if the Pope denounce them excommunicate, and may driue cut hereticall Kings from their kingdomes, as Wolfes, ſaith 
                           Bel. de pont. lib. 5. cap 7. Be a King neuer ſo vertuous, if he refuſe to ſtcope vnder the Popes primacy, preſently hee is an hereticke, liable to be depoſed, depriued, dethroned, and decapitated. Vide Saunders lib. de Monarch. viſib.

So that I may rightly ſay, Ieſuiticall Papiſme is the Catechiſme of Treaſon, teaching Subiects, that their Emperor or King may be depriued by the Pope, and the right of their kingdome conueyed ouer to others: and if they will not acknowledge it, they muſt be conſtrained by Armes, eyther of their owne Subiects, or other Catholike Princes, if the Pope will haue it ſo, yea euen to part with their kingdome and life alſo, ſaith Francis Bozius, lib. 2. c. 14.
                     Yea that the Pope is directly Lord of things temporal, the Ruler and Monarke of the world, ſaith Boz. de temp. eccl. Monar. lib▪ 1. cap. 3. fol. 98. the ſame Bozius, and ſo conſequently to haue power to depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe of kingdomes; ſo that I may truely affirme that which once one of the kings of America ſaid to a Spaniard, telling him of the diuiſion and diſpoſition of Pope Alexander the ſixt, concerning the new-found part of the world, the King anſwered, That the Pope was not the Non vicariii boni Dei, ſed diaboli &amp;c Vicar of a good God, but of a Deuill, who would giue that to others which did not belong vnto him: and ſurely in nothing doth the Pope more liuely ſhew himſelfe to be Sathans Vicar, then in medling with the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, and arrogating the Deuils title, All

                        Kingdome was not of this world: nor Peter would not caſt Nero out of his throne by the Thunderbolt of excommunication, or depoſition; nor any of the Apoſtles take from Caeſar his Scepter, or Subiects, or Kingdome, or life: yet he that brags he ſucceedes Simon Peter, 
                        Simonem Romae nemo fuiſſe negat, Owen. Epigr. 
                        (Simon, I grant, but not Peter) will by his excommunication binde Kings that they may not reigne, and Subiects that they may not obey, which is (to vſe 
                           Ʋrſpergenſis wordes) a diuelliſh Art, which hath brought in treachery vnder the cloake of religion, dangerous to Kings, and

damnable to Subiects. But it hath beene the Popes policie a long time, to make diſcord among Kings, and rebellion among Subiects: for it is well obſerued, that foure things ſpecially haue raiſed the Pope. 1 The diuiſion of the Empire. 2 The departure of the Emperor out of Italy. 3 The diſſention of Kings. 4 The rebellions and treaſons of people. And the ſpeciall motiue of this fourth Monſter, Rebellion, hath beene the diab olicall doctrine of ſeditious and bloudy Romaniſts, not Maſſe, but Mars-Prieſts, teaching and tempering with the people, that all the dominion of the world, both diuine and humane, was in Chriſt as man, and ſo now it is in the Pope the vicar of Chriſt, as Carer. de poteſtat. Rom. pontif. p. 111. 
                        Carerius writes: That Chriſt committed to Peter (the key-keeper of eternall life) the right of earthly and heauenly gouernment, and that in his place the Pope is vniuerſall Iudge, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, as an Iſid. Moſe. de maieſtat. p. 27. other writes: &amp; by vertue of this pretended claime of Peters ſucceſſor, and Peters primacy, that they may doe any thing; and as Platina writes in the life of Gregory, that he accuſtomed to vſe theſe words, Nos, nos, imperia, regna, &amp; principatus, &amp; quicquid mortales habere poſſunt, auferre poſſe &amp;c. We are able to take away Empires, Kingdomes, Principalities, or whaſoeuer mortall men can haue: for the Pope cries like Plintes frogge,

Thus make they their Lord of the ſeauen hilled City, a bloudy Biſhop, a 1 Tim. 3. 3. ſtriker, and a fighter, contrary to Pauls Canon, a man of bloud and a warrier; and all this muſt be cloaked vnder the colour of Peters chaire, (this holy-water ſweetens the Harlots cuppe) as if religion and rebellion ſprung out of one blade, as if faith had a knife to kill, and to teach grace to deſtroy nature. Thus theſe impoſtors, not Paſtors raiſe rebels, and preach the murther of Gods Annointed, inuenting opinions' of excommunication of Kings depoſition, abſolution of ſubiects from obedience; which queſtions are all like ſpirits, ſooner raiſed then put downe, beeing patronized by the deuoted Champions of the Popes chaire, Bellarmine, Allen, Carerius, Perron, Symancha, Suarez, Philopater, Saunders, Creſwell, Reynolds, Parſons, Becanus, &amp;c. laborious vaſſals to ambitious Popes, whoſe publiſhing of theſe pernicious errors, hath ouerthrowne many popiſh Families, brought a torture to their Conſciences, puniſhment to their karcaſſes, infamy to their progeny, ſcandall to their religion, for attempting treaſon vnder pretence of their Romiſh profeſſion. But let vs conſider (though by way of digreſſion) how and by what meanes this ambitious Antichriſt hath aſpired to this arrogant altitude, to ſet his chaire aboue Kings thrones, and to challenge a power to depriue Kings, and to make, or vnmake temporall Monarkes, a matter which requires a large volume, if we ſhould fully deſcribe their policy in riſing, and ruling; but I will but epitomize it, contracting it into a ſhort Compendium, it being by many learned Diuines in their ſeuerall workes more amply diſcouered.

Benef. lib. 1. c, 10. and Kings, did firſt eſpecially begin in Pope Boniface the third, who obtained of Phocas, that murdered his Maſter and Emperour Mauritius, to be created the vniuerſall Biſhop. So that the Pope is indebted to a King-killer for the glory of his kingdome, and euer ſince he hath made much of King-killers. Thus he obtained to be Head-Biſhop, and together with the Lombards began to rule the City of Rome: after that the Lombards challenging the City of Rome againe, Pope Zachary ſtirres vp Pipinus, depoſing Childericus King of France; and his ſonne Carolus magnus, to put down Aiſtulphus King of the Lombards, tranſlated the Empire to France, and diuided the ſpoyle between them; France to haue that which belonged to the Empire, and the Pope poſſeſſion of Rome, with ſuch donations as they now call S. Peters patrimony, and aſcribe the grant to Constantine the great.
                     After in tract of time, their liberall benefactors being dead, Pipinus, Carolus, and Lodouicus, and the Kings of France affections being ſomewhat cold to aſſiſt the Pope againſt the Princes of Italy, Oras ſome ſay by Leo the 3. and others ſay, the Empire was not tranſlated to the Germans by the Popes Decree, but by the people of Rome. Pope Gregory the fift practiſed with the Germans to reduce the Empire thither, referring the election to ſeauen Princes Electors of Germany, reſeruing to himſelfe the negatiue voyce, the firſt of which Emperors was Otho. But in proceſſe of time the Germane Emperors began to reſiſt the Popes of Rome, and therefore ſome they accurſed, ſome they depoſed, ſome they deſtroyed. The chiefe author, actor, and patrone of all pride, preſumption, and tyranny, was Pope Gregory the ſeuenth, alias Hildebrand, who laboured to make all temporall regiment ſubiect to his ſpirituall iuriſdiction. It were a long ſtory to rehearſe the diuelliſh practiſes of this proud Pope againſt Henry the fourth, Emperor, excommunicating

And after him Henry the fifth his ſonne, with his Empreſſe Constantia, are content to be crowned by Pope Celeſtine the third, receiuing the Crown from the Popes feete, and being ſet vpon the Emperors head, preſently with his foot ſtrooke it off againe, declaring he had power to depoſe him, if hee deſerued. So againe Philippus brother to this Henry, by Popes accurſed; and Otho Duke of Saxony placed in his ſeate, and the ſame Otho not long after by Popes againe diſpoſſeſſed.

                        DIuers waies haue the Popes of Rome laboured to exalt themſelues aboue all mortall men, and to deifie themſelues, teaching their flattering birds (the Popes paraſites) like Pſapho to cry, Max. Tyr. Serm. 
                        Pſapho eſt magnus Deus, Pſapho is a great God. Their Decrees, Decretals, Extrauagants, Pontificials, Clementinee, Buls, &amp;c. with their clawbacke Canoniſts, Monkes, Friers, and late Ieſuites extolling to the skies the Papall Monarchy, haue been the Or like Jupiters Prieſts to Alexander, flatter with à Ioue late.

Duo Our Prieſthood, let him look vp to the firmament, where hee may ſee two great lights, the Sunne and the Moone, one ruling ouer the day, the other ouer the night: So in the firmament of the vniuerſall Church, God hath ſet two great dignities, the authority of the Pope, and Emperor, Greg. 9. lib. 1. decret. tit. 33. cap. 6. of the which two this our dignity is ſo much the weightier, as that we muſt giue account to God for the Kings of Ibidem. the earth, and for the Lawes of men. Wherefore know ye Emperors, that ye depend vpon the iudgement of vs, and we muſt not be reduced to your will; for Innocent. de Maior. &amp; obedi. c. Solitae. looke what difference there is betweene the Sunne and the Moone, ſo

great is the power of the Pope ruling ouer the day, that is, ouer the ſpiritualty, aboue Emperors and Kings ruling ouer the night, that is, ouer the Laity. Now ſeeing then the Gloſſa ibidem. Earth is ſeauen times bigger then the Moone, and the Sunne eight times greater then the earth, it followes that the Popes dignity many degrees doth ſurmount the eſtate of Emperors. And although Conſtantine: the great writing to a Pope alleadged the words of Peter, 1 Pet. 2. 13. Submit your ſelues to euery humane creature, as to Kings, Innocent. Gloſſ. ibidem. &amp;c. Yet in their Decretals they expound the minde of Peter, to exhort all ſubiects, and not his ſucceſſors to be ſubiect, proouing the Prieſthood to be aboue Kings, by the wordes of Ier. 1. 10.

Emperors and Kings bee more inferior then lead is to gold: for doe you not ſee the Idem ibidem. neckes of Kings and Princes bend vnder our knees, yea and think themſelues happy and well defenced if they may kiſſe our hands?
                     What doe wee talke of Kings? The Pope is aboue Angels, as his Clarke Anten. in tertia part. Summae Maioris. 
                        Antoninus writes, That hee is greater then Angels in foure things. 1 In iuriſdiction. 2 In adminiſtration of Sacraments. 3 In knowledge. 4 In reward. And ſo in Bulla Clementis, the Pope commands the Angels of Paradiſe to abſolue the ſoule of man out of purgatory, and to bring it into the glory of Paradiſe.
                     Who is able to comprehend the greatnes of my power and ſeate? For by me onely P. Marcellꝰ diſt. 17. ca.

                     This order of P. Nicolaus. diſt. 22. cap. omnes. Prieſts, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarkes and Cardinals, the Church of Rome hath inſtituted, following the example of the Angelicall Army in heauen, and the Apoſtles on earth: For P. Anacletus. diſt. 22. c. Sacroſancta. among them there was a diſtinction of power and authority, albeit they were all Apoſtles, yet it was granted to Peter (they all agreeing to it) that hee ſhould haue ſuperiority ouer them all, and Ibidem. Petrus non à Petra ſed 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

And I will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde vpon earth, &amp;c. v. 19. Seeing then ſuch power is giuen to Peter, and to the Pope in Peter, as his ſucceſſor; who is then in all the P Nicolaus in tantum, diſt. 22. world, that ought not to be ſubiect to my Decrees, which haue ſuch power in heauen, in hell, in earth, with the quicke, &amp; alſo the dead? whereupon Pope Clement in his Bull of lead ſent to 
                           Ʋienna, granted to all ſuch as died in their peregrination to Rome, that the paine of hell ſhould not touch them: And all ſuch as tooke the In Bulla Viennae in Scrinijs priuilegiorum. holy Croſſe vpon them, ſhould euery one at his requeſt not onely be deliuered, but alſo deliuer 3. or 4. ſoules out of Purgatory.
                     And againe, Chriſt ſaid to Peter: I haue prayed for thee that thy faith ſhall not faile; hauing Diſt. 21. cap. decretis. ſuch a promiſe and aſſurance, who then will not beleeue my doctrine? So that all they that P Nicolaus. diſt. 22. cap. omnes. beleeue not my doctrine, or ſtand againſt

the priuiledge of my Church of Rome, I pronounce them heretickes; for Ibidem. he goeth againſt the Faith, which goeth againſt her who is the mother of the Faith. And moreouer to ſhew the ſtrange vertue of the Popes keyes, his Schoole Doctors haue a twofold diſtinction: Gabriel. Biol. lib. 4 diſt. 19. 1. Clauis ordinis, the key of order, hauing authority to binde and looſe, but not ouer the perſons whom they binde &amp; looſe: Petrus de Palude. which authority they take not immediately from Chriſt, but from the Pope the Vicar of Chriſt. 2. Key is Clauis Iuriſdictionis, the key of Iuriſdiction, which the Pope hath from Chriſt immediately, as being his Vicar, hauing not onely power to binde and looſe, but alſo dominion ouer them on whom this key is exerciſed. By the iuriſdiction of which key all are ſubiect to the Pope, the Diſt. 96. cap. Imperator. Emperours ought to ſubdue their executions to him. Onely the Pope is ſubiect to no creature, no not to himſelfe, Gabr. Diel. lib. 4. diſt. 19. except hee liſt, in foro poenitentiae, to his ghoſtly father, ſubmitting himſelfe as a ſinner, but not as a Pope, the papall maieſty euer remaining vnminiſhed.
                     No Diſt. 40. cap. ſi papa. man muſt iudge or accuſe the Pope of any crime, as murder, adultery, ſimony, &amp;c. but as the Aug. de Ancho Iewes were commanded to obey the High Prieſt of the Leuiticall Order, ſo are all Chriſtians bound to obey the Pope, Chriſts Lieutenant in earth. Concerning whoſe obedience or diſobedience, reade Deutron. 17. 12. where their ordinary Gloſſe payes it home ſaying, That he who denieth to the Prieſt obedientiam, obedience, lyeth vnder the ſentence of condemnation, as much as he that denieth to God his omnipotentiam, his omnipotence.
                     The greatneſſe of the Popes prieſthood began in Melchiſedech, 
                        Antoninus. ſolemnized in Aaron, continued in his children, perfectionated in Chriſt, repreſented in Peter, exalted in the vniuerſall iuriſdiction, and manifeſted in Sylueſter; &amp;c. So that in regard of this prieſtly preheminence, it may be verified of the Pope which the Pſalmiſt writes, Pſalm. 8. 6. 7. &amp;c. Thou haſt put all things vnder his feete, all ſheepe and oxen, the beaſts of the field, the fowles of the aire, and the fiſh of the Sea, &amp;c.
                        
which place his owne Summae maioris 3. part. diſti. 22. 
                        Antoninus hath applied to the Pope, and with a clearkely Paraphraſe hath expounded, thus, By Oxen are ſignified the Iewes and heretickes: by the Cattell of the fielde, Pagans: by Sheepe all Chriſtian men, Princes, Prelates, and people: by the Birds, Angels and powers of Heauen: by the Fiſhes of the Sea, the ſoules departed in paine or purgatory, as Gregory by his prayer deliuered the ſoule of Traiane out of hell: By them which paſſe through the paths of the Sea, are ſignified ſuch as are in Purgatory, and ſtand in need of others helpe, and yet be in their iourney, Viatores, &amp; de foro Papa, paſſengers, and belong to the Court of the Pope, and may be relieued out of the ſtorehouſe of the Church by the participation of Indulgence.
                     And though it be truely doubted that pardons haue no power to extend to the departed, yet Romes Doctors can helpe that; for though it was ſaid to Peter, Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſevpon earth, and ſo being not on earth, they cannot Antoninꝰ. Auguſt: de Ancho. be looſed, yet they will diſſolue that doubt by a diſtinction Thomas part. 4. vpon, ſuper terram, vpon the earth, that may be taken two waies, eyther to the looſer, and ſo a Pope being dead cannot looſe; or to the looſed, which muſt be vpon the earth, or about the earth.
                     But what do I talke of the Popes power in ſuch points, the whole Quire of the Popes Cleargy in their books, tractations, diſtinctions, gloſſes, ſummaries, &amp;c. ſing altogether ſuch notes.
                     The Pope (ſay they) being the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt, throughout the whole World, in the ſtead of the liuing 
                           The Romiſh quire to flatter Antichriſt. Baptiſta de Salis. Bonauentura. Campenſis. Coclaeus Durandus in ſpeculo. Driedo de Eccleſ. Scripturis, &amp; digmat. Lord, hath that dominion on earth which Chriſt would not haue, (yet had it in habitu, and gaue it to Peter in Actu) that is, the vniuerſall iuriſdiction, both ſpirituall, and alſo temporall, which double iuriſdiction is intimated by the two ſwords in the Goſpell; and by the wiſemens offering of Incenſe and Gold to Chriſt, to ſignifie that the dominion ſpirituall and temporall belong to Chriſt, and his Vicar.
                     And as Chriſt ſaith; All power is giuen to him both in

Heauen and Earth, ſo it is holden incluſiue, that the vicar of Chriſt hath power on things ccleſtiall, terreſtriall, and Edw. Pouelus contra Lutherum Ecchius in Enchirid. Franciſcus Fulgo.

Joan. de Turrecre: de Eccleſia. infernall, which he tooke immediatly of Chriſt, and all other take it mediatly by Peter and the Pope. And they that ſay; The Pope hath onely dominion in ſpirituall things, may be compared to the Counſellors of the King of Aram, 1 Kin. 20. 23. Their Gods are Gods of Mountaines, and therefore they ouercame vs; but let vs fight againſt them in the plaine or vallies, and doubtleſſe we ſhall ouercome them: So Counſellors flatter Kings, ſaying, Popes and Prelats be Gods of Mountaines, that is, of ſpirituall things▪ but not of vallies, that is, of temporall things: Therefore let vs fight againſt them in the vallies, in the power of temporall poſſeſſions, and ſo we ſhall preuaile ouer them. But what ſaith God? v. 28. Becauſe the Aramites haue ſaid; that the Lord is the God of mountaines and not God of the vallies, therefore will I deliuer all this great multitude into thine hands, and ye ſhall know that Lanfrancus contra Wiclef. I am the Lord.
                     Which place (though very impertinent in this point) they vrge with great importunity, to proue the Popes power ouer all mountaines and vallies, that is, ſay they; ouer ſpirituall and temporal matters: and ſo very vnthankfully Conſtantinus Sylueſtro reddidit iniuſtè detentum: 10.

Rabanus ſuper Math. cap. 16. they regard Conſtantines gift of their patrimony to Sylueſter, ſaying; It was not ſo much a Donation, as a Reſtitution.
                     Yea (they ſay) the Pope is ſuperior to Emperors, yea, ſuperior to Lawes, and free from all Conſtitutions.

                     The Faith, Supremacy, Chaire of Peter; Keyes of Heauen, power to bind and looſe; all theſe be inſeparable to Vide Ioan.

I will very briefly wright of it, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to make Iliads after Homer.

                        THE Romane Church, or rather Court of Rome, wholly degenerated, and arrogating a temporall Monarchy, ſwelling with a forged puffe of pride and primacy appropriated to the Papall Chaire, challenge an exorbitant and vſurped power of depoſition of Kings, and of abſolution of Subiects from alleagiance to them; which two-fold power is termed the principall warders of Saint Peters Keyes, without which the Bulla Pij Quinti. Church could not haue beene well ſhut, or opened.
                     This power of excommunicating, depoſing, and depriuing

Kings, and of abſoluing Subiects from obedience to them, they principally aſſume from a pretended primacy belonging to the Pope, ouer all ſpirituall and temporall men or matters, deriued to them (as they pleade) from a ſupremacy in Peter, (whoſe Succeſſorſhip hath intitled them to ſuch a power and priority) two points oft alleadged, yet neuer proued; yet this primacy of Popes (as their Bellarmine ſaith) is the chiefe point of Catholike Faith, and the foundation of all Religion.
                     For which power the Champions of Rome ſtoutly ſtand, and among the reſt, the ſtatizing Cardinall, Romes-Rabbi, Bellarmine, the moſt expert Gameſter at the Popes Primero, in Tract. de poteſt.

                     And as the ſame Bellarmine, perſonating Tortus, ſaith; Conuenit inter omnes, poſſe Pontificem maximum iure deponere, It is agreed vpon among all, that the Pope of Rome may by right and law depoſe Princes: which ſpeech was too generall; for many popiſh Watſon, quodlib. 8. art. 7. 8 Barclayus, de authorit.

                         Doctors doubt of it, and denie the papall intruſion into Caeſars Chaire; and ſome that did hold it, haue recanted it, as Tanquerellus commanded ſo by the Court of Paris, Florentinus Iacobus, and Thomas Blanztus, the two laſt, holding this for a propoſition, Pontificem in omnes habere temporalem poteſtatem, That the Pope hath a temporall power ouer all, but they came to recantation; nay, Hart (an hearty louer of the Pope) yet his opinion different from Bellarmines, Whoſoeuer make the Pope aboue Kings, as a temporall Lord, Nihil habere rationis, aut probabilitatis, to haue neither ſhew of reaſon, or probability, ſaith he.
                     Yet I confeſſe, the generall voice of moderne Papiſts, and among the reſt, the Ieſuites, who diſpoſitiuè, naturally are inclined to diſobedience, and pragmatically, and dogmatically, declare the ſame: Theſe are the chiefe Inſtruments,

but Treaſon, conſummatiue, comes from the Pope, firſt depoſing, then commanding, and warranting diſloyalty, and conſpiracy againſt them.

                        Auguſtinus Triumphus ſaith, The Emperor of Heauen may depoſe the Emperor of the Earth, in as much as there is no power but of him: but the Pope is inueſted with the authority of the Emperor of Heauen, hee may therefore depoſe the Emperor of the Earth, and as the ſame ſaith; Art. 3. The Emperor is ſubiect to the Pope two wayes, 1. By a filiall ſubiection in all ſpirituall things, 2. By a miniſteriall ſubiection in his adminiſtration of temporall things: for the Emperor is the Popes Miniſter, by whom he adminiſters temporall things: ſo he.

                        Capiſtranus agrees with him, The Emperor, if hee be incorrigible, for any mortall ſinne, may bee depoſed and depriued: the ſentence of the Pope alone without a Councell, is ſufficient againſt the Emperour or any other. It is manifeſt therefore how much the Popes authority is aboue the Imperial celſitude, which it tranſlates, examines, confirmes, or infringes, approoues, or reiects: if hee offends, he puniſhes, depoſes, and depriues him. So he,

them (as their owne Biſhop Meltiades did to Conſtantine the Great) to be ſupreame Head not onely in Temporall, but alſo in Spirituall things, as Euſebius records it, lib. 1. c. 5.
                     But peraduenture ſome Papiſt may reply and ſay, that I doe not reckon aright, in making Gregory the ſeauenth, the firſt Pope that depoſed an Emperor, which yet is affirmed by their owne writers: for Leo the third Emperor was excommunicated by Gregory the ſecond, and depriued of all his Temporalities hee held in Italy; and the Greeke Emperors were remoued from the Empire by Leo the third, Biſhop of Rome, and ſo of ſome others. Which obiection is ſo frequently anſwered by our Diuines, who haue written about this point of the Popes power in this kinde, that for breuity I will paſſe it ouer in a worde, That Gregory the ſecond did not depriue Leo the third Emperor of his temporalities, but onely was an agent, or as the head of rebellion in the reuolt of the Italians from the Emperor, not by his vniuerſall authority now claimed, but by a popular ſedition then raiſed. And to the ſecond, That the Greeke Empire was tranſlated by Or as ſome write, by Gregory the fift. 
                        Leo the third to the Germanes, is much doubted: for

Sigebert. in Anno 731. ſome hiſtorians write, it was tranſlated by a Decree of the people of Rome, not by the Popes keyes; yet probably he might haue his head, hand, and heart in it: for as Pope Adrian the ſixt ſaid, All miſchiefe came from the chiefe Biſhop of Rome into the whole Church, and by his Legate Cleregatus promiſed reformation to the Germanes.
                     The Popes of Rome haue a long time laboured to riſe to this primacy of pride by degrees: firſt aboue Biſhops, as in Boniface the third: after aboue Kings and Emperors, ſpecially in Gregory the ſeauenth and his ſucceſſors: yet thoſe aſpiring wings clipt by Councels, Wormes, Papia, Brixis, Mentz; till at laſt, two of the worſt Councels, the Laterane and Tridentine, did lift vp the Pope to the top of the pinnacle, not onely aboue Kings and Councels, but aboue Gods counſels the ſacred Scriptures:

                           Tantae molis erat Romanum ſurgere papam.
                        
                     
                     
                        
But let vs a little look vpon this queſtion (which yet is like a Spirit, ſooner raiſed then put downe,) of the papall power of Kings depoſition.
                     A ſpiritual power in the Pope of primacy I know none, temporall much leſſe, but this ſame pretended Eccleſia Romana eſt priuatiua, non primitiua. priuatiue power leaſt of al: for it is not in any place to be found, that God hath giuen to the Pope, yea to any man, power to make or vnmake temporall King 
                           〈◊〉
                         for hee that can depoſe a King, muſt bee aboue a King; but regall power is the higheſt power on earth, poſt Deum ſecundus eſt, &amp; ſolo Deo 
                        A King is not bound to giue an account to Popes or people, but God. 
                        minor, as Tertullian of Kings, next after God, and inferiour to none but God: Super quem non eſt niſi ſolus Deus, as Optatus Mileuitanus, aboue whom there is none but God alone. So King Pſalm. 51. 4. 
                        Dauid, Tibi ſoli peccaui, againſt thee onely haue I finned. So that I may ſay with De poteſt. regia, &amp; papali. c. 10. Otho depoſed John 22. Pope. &amp;c. 
                        Iohn of Paris, In the Emperour is inueſted a power to depoſe the Pope, (as formerly many haue beene) if he abuſe his power, becauſe he is his ſuperiour; but not in the Pope, for he is, and ought to be his inferiour: and with this Iohn Maior agree many other, Almaine and Occam, as Quae. 2. de poteſt. eccl. &amp; Laic. c. 12. 
                        Almaine alleadges Occams opinion, and makes it his owne concluſion, That the Pope hath no power eyther by excommunication, or by any other meanes to depoſe a Prince ftom his royall dignity; and further c. 9. 10. 11. affirmes with Occam, ſaying, The Emperour is not bound to ſweare allegiance to the Pope, but the Pope if he hold any temporal poſſeſſions, is bound to ſweare allegiance to the Emperor, and to pay him tribute. The Scripture recites 19. Kings of Iſrael, and 14. of Iudah, who brake the couenant made with the Lord, yet none depoſed by Prieſt or Prophet for that cauſe.
                     
                     But the Champions of the Popes power in this kinde, alleadge ſome preſidents of the Prieſts in the olde law, who (as they ſay) by vertue of their Prieſthood haue depoſed and depriued Kings from their ſeates, which power they labour to deriue and appropriate to the Popes office: I will name but two of them in two examples.
                     1 Cardinall Defenſ. Angl. Catho. c. 5. 2 Chron. 26. 
                        Allen alleadgeth Azarias the high Prieſt, who with 
                           •
                        o other Prieſts put downe Ozias, ſmitten with leproſie, by force out of the Temple, and depriued him of his regall authority: Ergo (ſay they) it is lawfull for the

high Prieſt, that is, the Pope, to driue hereticall Kings, that is, ſpirituall Leapers, out of the Temple of Gods▪ Church, and Territories of their kingdome, by excommunication, which is a ſeparation; and then by depoſition, which is a finall depriuation of them, and deputation of ſome other Regent, as Azarias committed the kingdome to be then gouerned by Iotham his ſonne.
                     Wee anſwere (as ſome of our Church haue anſwered) That Azarias did not depriue Ozias of his regall power, for he held it to his dying day; onely his ſonne Iotham as a kinde of Viceroye was ſurrogated, becauſe the immediate hand of God had ſmitten him with leproſie: for his leproſie he was puniſhed to liue apart, a priuate life, not to 2 Chro. 26. 20. Viſa lepra Sacerdotes regem leproſum ad feſtine egrediendum monent. Caietan. in 2. Paral. 26. be depriued of his inheritance. Ambition, couetouſneſſe, yea all ſinne is a leproſie (hath not the Pope ſuch a contagion?) why then he may as well be depriued of his Miter, being a grand ſinner, and ſo a great leaper, as any other. Indeed Ozias, or Vzziah greatly ſinned in preſuming to vſurpe the Prieſts office, tranſgreſſing againſt the Lord, in going into the Temple to burne incenſe vpon the Altar of 
                           Ʋ. 16. Sacerdotis eſt tantum arguere, non mouere arma. &amp;c. Chryſoſt. 18 Leuitic. 13. incenſe; and Azariah with the other Prieſts withſtood Vzziah the King, telling him, it pertained not to him to burne incenſe, but to the Prieſts, the ſonnes of Aaron conſecrated to offer it: and was ſmitten of the Lord for it with leproſie, and ſo liued apart according to the Law, yet ſtill was King in eſſe, though not in execution.
                     2 Cardinall Bellarmine alleadgeth Iehoiada the High 2 Kings 11. Prieſt, who commanded Athalia the Queene to bee ſlaine, and Ioaſh to ſucceed; implying an inference, that ſo it is lawfull for Popes to doe the like.
                     We anſwer, that Athalia an vſurper and murderer, killing all the royall ſeed, excepting only the ſecretly preſerued Ioaſh the vndoubted heyre of the Crowne, beeing proclaimed and annointed King with a generall conſent of all; Iehoiada by the authority of the King, and not as High Prieſt, but rather tanquam regis patruus, &amp; Protector, as his Kinſman and Protector, the King being in his minority ſeauen yeares olde, and Iehoiada being his Allye, hauing

married the Kings An
                           •
                        , and ſo bound by the Law of Nature and Nations to defend the Kings right, and to reuenge the tyranny of a bloudy Queen againſt the Kings killed progeny: and Iehoiadaes commandement was confirmed by the Kings authority, and with the common conſent and Counſell of the land, not as being High Prieſt, but as chiefe of his Tribe, to reuenge the crying bloud of the royall offspring murthered by vſurping Athalia, to depriue her of her vſurped regiment and life: what is this to depoſe a lawfull King by the authority of the Pope? Kings ſhall anguſte ſedere, as Tully ſaid to Caeſar, haue quaking Scepters, vnquiet ſeates, and narrow limits, if the Pope haue power to depriue them of their power &amp; ſtate. But to paſſe ouer other the like examples alleadged by Romaniſts in this kinde, I will touch thoſe foure things which they obiect, and ſay, doe diſſolue regall right, and make Kings who are culpable of ſuch faults, to forfeit their Crownes. 1. Tyranny. 2. Infidelity. 3. Hereſie. 4. Apoſtacy. The Popiſh aſſertions heerein runne in the affirmatiue, that all, or any one is ſufficient to depriue a King of his Crown. The opinions of Proteſtants run in the negatiue, that none of theſe are ſufficient to make a King forfeit his dignity and Diademe.
                     To begin with the firſt: Tyranny doth not cut off a King from his ſoueraignty. Who a greater Tyrant then King Saul, who 1 Sam. 24. 12. hunted after Dauids ſoule to take it: yet who was ſo 1 Sam. 22. 14. faithfull among all his ſeruants as Dauid? confeſſed by Sauls owne mouth, To be more righteous then he, for thou haſt rendred mee good, and I haue rendred thee euill: yea this 1 Sam. 24. 18. 
                        Saul ſuch a tyrant, that he commanded Doeg to 1 Sam. 22. 18. 19. fall vpon the Lords Prieſts, and Doeg at his commandement flew ſouneſcore and fiue perſons, that did weare a linnen Ephod, and did ſmite Nob the Prieſts City, with the edge of the ſword, both man and woman, childe and ſuckling, oxe and aſſe, and ſheepe with the ſword.
                     Yet Dauid, no priuate, or plebe
                           •
                        an ſubiect, but a man by Gods commandement deſigned for the Kingdome,

cheefe Captaine and Coronel of Sauls Army, and heire apparent to the Crowne; and hauing opportunity to depriue Saul of his life, and importunity of his followers to doe the deed, yet heare his voice, The 1 Sam. 24. 7. Lord keepe me from doing that thing vnto my Maſter the Lords Annointed, to lay my hand vpon him, for he is the Lords Annointed: and the ſame Dauid to Abiſhai Deſtroy 1 Sam. 26. 9. him not, for who can lay his hand vpon the Lords Annointed, and be guiltleſſe? O heauenly voice of holy Dauid, how different are Popelings from Dauids reſolution! Occaſionem victoria Dauid habebat in manibus, incantum &amp; ſecurum aduerſarium ſine labore poterat iugulare, advictoriam opportunitas hortabatur: ſed obſtabat Diuinorum memoria mandatorum: non mittam manum in vnctum Domini, repreſſit cum gladio manum, &amp; dum timuit oleum, ſeruauit inimicum, As moſt elegantly, and excellently writes 
                           Lib. 2. cōtra Parmenianum. Volebam hoſtem vincere, ſed prius eſt diuina praecepta ſeruare, &amp;c. Ibidem Optatus. Their vnction makes them ſacred, ſo that their fatall touch, makes the Subiect ſacrilegious. 
                        Optatus, Dauid had a preſent occaſion of ſecurity of victory, and might without any difficulty, or danger haue killed his vnkind and vnconſiderate enemy; opportunity might haue preſſed him to it, but the remembrance of Gods commandements ſtay his hand, Touch not my Annointed: This keepes backe the hand and ſword, and fearing the regall oyle, fauours a diſmall enemy.
                     Now Tyranny may be of two kinds, either of vſurped regiment and dominion, without any ciuill title and intereſt hauing no titular foundation, but violent vſurpation; and herein ſubiection is not neceſſary, Quoad obedientiam, if Quoad Suſt
                              •…
                           ntiam: Herein patience more requiſite then obedience. 2 Kind is, when ordinary and lawfull power degenerates into tyranny and cruelty by abuſe; and herein 
                           Reade Tollett, de occidendo Tyranno lib. 5. c. 6. Mariana. Fra de Veron &amp;c. Papiſts giue liberty, Tyrannum occidere licet, It is lawfull to kill a Tyrant, contrary to Dauid; God forbid that I ſhould lay mine hand vpon the Lords Annointed; 1 Sam. 26. 11. Meaning Saul, a Tyrant by abuſe, but not by vſurpation: but we haue handled this before, and therefore In the former Booke c. 5. of Britan. Vota.
                         leaue it.
                     2. Infidelity doth not depriue a King of his regiment: Oh but replies the Papiſt, All title to Dominion, hath

foundation in the grace of Iuſtice, Charity, and Piety; ſo 
                           Ʋid. Quaeſt. Armenic lib. 10. c. 4. that by impiety or infldelity, they make forfeiture of their authority. Anſwer: It is prouidence, not grace, that diſpoſeth ciuill titles; grace, not prouidence, that makes them comfortable: In a ſpirituall ſenſe, impious and vnfaithfull men, are vſurpers, I meane by a ſpirituall right; (for 1 Tim. 4. 8. godlineſſe hath the promiſes of this life) yet haue they a ciuill and ſure title among men, by birthright, ſucceſſion, election, or other acquiſition, by which titles ſuch rights are deuolued to them, that we ſay with Saint De ciuit dei. lib. 5. c. 11. 
                        Auſten; Qui dedit Mario, ipſe &amp; Caeſari, He that gaue dominion to Marius, the ſame gaue it to Caeſar; he that to Auguſtus, the ſame to Nero; he that to gentle 
                           Ʋespaſian, the ſame to bloody Domitian; he that to Conſtantine the Chriſtian, the ſame to the Apoſtate Iulian: for the Pſal. 22. 28. Kingdome is the Lords, and hee ruleth among Nations, the moſt High hath power ouer the Kingdome of Men, and giueth it to whomſoeuer hee will, and appointeth ouer it the moſt abiect among men, ſaith Dan. 4. 14. 
                        Daniel; and ſuffereth for the ſinnes of the people, a Kingdome Eccleſiaſticus 10. 8. to be tranſlated from one people to another, yea, an hypocrite, or infidell to reigne ouer them; neither muſt man ſeeke to diſplace or diſpoſſeſſe an Infidell King, but ſay with 1 Sam. 26. 10. 
                        Dauid; Either the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to die, or hee ſhall deſcend into battell, and periſh: knowing the ſaying of the ſonne of Syrack to be true, Eccleſiaſticus 10. 10. 11. Tyranny is of ſmall indurance, and he that is to day a King, to morrow is dead.
                     3. Hereſie is not ſufficient to depriue a King of his temporall Inheritance. Popiſh Diuinity is herein knowne, let De Rom. Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 7. 
                        Bellarmine be the mouth of all the reſt: Chriſtians are not bound, nor may, with the euident danger of Religion, tollerate an vnbeleeuing King: when Kings and Princes become Heretickes are depriued of all right of rule, either naturall, oeco
                              •…
                           cal, or ciuill. Fr. Ouand. 4. d. 13. p. 347. heretickes, they may be iudged of the Church, and bee depoſed from the gouernement, neither is there any wrong done them, if they be depoſed.
                     If any Prince of a ſheepe become a wolfe, that is to ſay, of a Chriſtian become an Hereticke, the Paſtor of the Church, by excommunication may driue him away, and

withall command the people that they follow him not, and ſo depriue him of his dominion ouer his Subiects: ſo Subiects are freed from all obedience, and allegiance to them. Turrecr. Sum. de eccl. lib. 2. c. 11. 4. farre goes the Cardinall. Now who are Heretickes? All thoſe Kings which decline from the Papacy, and denie his Supremacy. The Cardinall thinkes as much: Regnante Conſtantino florebat fides Chriſtiana, &amp;c. While Constantine reigned, the Chriſtian Faith flouriſhed; when Conſtantius ruled, Arrianiſme, when Iulian, Ethniciſme; when Henry the eighth and Edward the ſixth, Luthenariſme, when Elizabeth, Caluiniſme proſpered: All Proteſtant Princes by the verdict of the Pope and his Paraſites, be Hereticks, and ſo conſequently to be depoſed, if this their hereſie (which yet is the Catholicke verity, and ſincere and ſound profeſſion of the Goſpell) be accompanied with the Popes excommunication: and yet it is a great queſtion, and neuer yet proued by the Scripture, that Kings are ſubiect to this cenſure of excommunication; it is diſputed much both wayes; and let it be yeelded for argument ſake, Ex abundante, That Saint Theod. hiſtor. Eccleſ. lib. 5. c. 18. 
                        Ambroſe did iuſtly with Theodoſius in that abſtention; for I doubt whether it was a complete excommunication: for a King is ſubiect to the presbyteriall Cure, not Court; to be informed in his conſcience in the Pulpet, not to be corrected in the Conſiſtory by puniſhment; to be directed, not iudged, or remoued from the company of his faithfull Subiects, much leſſe to be depoſed, or depriued of his regiment ouer them; yet let it bee granted for argument ſake, that Princes may be ſubiect to the cenſure of excommunication, which yet is ſparingly to be vſed againſt Princes, as Contra. Epiſt. Parmen. lib. 3. c. 2. 
                        Auſten counſelleth: yet though the ſentence of excommunication be direfull, making them for a time as Ethnicks, Sit tibiſicut Ethnicus, ſaith our Math. 18. 17. Sauiour, Let him be vnto thee as an Heathen Man or Publicane: It is tanquam, nonpluſquam, as an Heathen man, not worſe then an Heathen Man. Loyalty and obedience to Ethnicke Kings is to be performed, as the precepts and preſidents of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles plainly teach all: The ſpirituall ſword onely depriues of ſpirituall rights, to depriue him of the Sacrament, not of the

Scepter: ſhuts out of the Kingdome of Heauen, not meddles with the Kingdome of Earth.
                     Excommunication is not an extirpation, it ſerues not to take away any mans temporall goods of body, or life, or Kingdome on Earth; it hath power ouer ſinnes, not ouer poſſeſſions, as De Conſid. ad Eugen. lib. 2. 
                        Bernard to Pope Eugenius: It ſerues to tame the ſoule, not to terrifie or deſtroy the body; it cannot bind Kings that they ſhould not reigne, or abſolue Subiects that they ſhould not obey, or depoſe Kings from their regall authority, by which pretence of diuelliſh pollicy, in challenging a ſpirituall power of Kings excommunication, the Pope hath plagued the World with many temporall rebellions.
                     4. Apoſtacy takes not away Soueraignty. Iulian an apparent Apoſtate, and wicked Idolater, as Saint Aug. in Pſal. 124. 
                        Auſten cals him, yet as the ſame Father ſpeakes of it, Milites Chriſtiani ſeruierunt huic Imperatori infideli: &amp; quando dicebat, producite aciem, i
                              •…
                           ra illam gentem, ſtatim obtemperabant: The Chriſtian Souldiers ſerued this Infidel Emperor, and when he called to produce the Army, or to goe againſt any Nation, they preſently obeyed; not becauſe they wanted power to reſiſt: for his whole Army for the moſt part were Chriſtians, as their voices to Iouinian Iulians Succeſſor teſtifie, Ruff. lib. 2. hiſt. cap. 1. 
                        Omnes vna voce confeſſi ſunt ſe eſſe Chriſtianos, They all confeſſed with one accord, that they were Chriſtians; but their obedience grounded vpon Saint Auſt. vb, ſupra. 
                        Austens reference, Subiectes fuiſſe, propter Dominum aternum, Domino temporali, Subiect to their temporall Lord, * Ala. contra execut. Angl. iuſt. pa. 167. Bellar. de rom. pontif. lib. 5. cap. 7. for the eternall Lords ſake. And though ſome of the great Diuines of Rome, ſay; that the Apoſtles were ſubiect to Infidell or apoſtate Princes, and many Martyrs obedient, becauſe they wanted power to reſiſt; and that they might haue lawfully reſiſted, if they had had ſtrength: when rather I may ſay with Tertul. in Apologet. 
                        Tertullian, that they had power, but might not lawfully reſiſt. The Apoſtles were no Temporizers, to command to pray for Nero, if the time, and not the truth, had not moued them to doe it for conſcience ſake: Shall Subiects, for Heathen or wicked Kings be 1 Tim. 2. 1. 2. enioyned

to poure forth prayers &amp; ſupplications, and withall be willing (if they haue power) to poure out their Soueraignes blood? The Prophet Ieremy exhorted the exiled Iewes to offer vp their prayers for the life of the King of Babylon: hee would not haue willed them to haue prayed for their perſecutor, if it had beene a duty contrary to Chriſtian profeſſion, or for lacke of power, to fall to ſupplication. VVhen King Eſter 3. 13. 
                        Aſſuerus had made a decree to kill and deſtory all the Iewes, both yong and old, children and women in one day, what doe they? rebell, or riſe vp in armes to reſiſt with violence? No, no, ſorrow, Eſter 4. 3. and faſting, weeping, and mourning, ſackecloth, and aſhes, are their weapons. When Iulian the Apoſtate, threatned the Chriſtian World; Lachrimae vnicum medicamentum aduerſus eum, ſaith Orat. 1. in Iulianum. 
                        Nazianzene: Teares the onely medicine againſt his miſcheefe, teares were their Speares, Orizons their weapons; They knew that they Rom. 13▪ 2. that reſiſted power, reſiſted the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall receiue to themſelues damnation. Theſe had not beene catechized in the Popes Schoole, teaching Subiects that the Pope hath power to depriue Kings, if they be defectiue in their regiment, or not pliable to his commandement; but were obedient, as the Apoſtle Rom. 13. 5. exhorts, Propter conſcientiam, for conſcience ſake.
                     Oh but will Maſter In his cenſure vpon the Apology. 
                        Parſons reply, We hold this point, that a Prince is to be obeyed Propter conſcientiam, for conſcience ſake; but not Contrae conſcientiam, Againſt his conſcience: And he is ſo ſtiffe in this aſſertion, that he ſaith, If one authority, example, or teſtimony out of Scripture, Fathers, or Councels, contradict it, we then ſpeake to purpoſe. VVe anſwer; Againſt Conſcience rightly inſtructed, and warranted by the word, It is true: but there is Aſinina, lupina, or leproſa conſcientia, A fooliſh, woluiſh, or leprous conſcience, which vicious or erroneous conſcience is not rightly called conſcience, but error, and peruerſeneſſe, and therein it failes. If a King command things expreſſely contrary to Gods word, the Acts 3. 19. Apoſtles rule then is plaine, VVe muſt obey God rather then men; yet not fall to violence,

or outward reſiſtance in body, but in ſpirit; ſubmitting our bodies to ſuffer with patience what ſhall bee inflicted, like the three Dan. 3. 21. Children to Nabuchadnezar; but in our ſoules to ſhew our ſelues more then Conquerors for our Conſcience ſake.
                     Thus doe we ſee, that the foure forenamed crimes, Tyranny, Infidelity, Hereſie, Apoſtacy, (yet great, and greeuous ſinnes) are not ſufficient to depriue a King of his regall Inheritance, or to free his Subiects from their obedience.

                     Some of the cheefe pillars of Popery defend the direct, ordinary, and inherent authority of the Pope; whereby as Lord of the whole VVorld, in all temporall matters hee may at his pleaſure depoſe Emperors, and Princes: The

And this opinion, that the Pope is Lord of all the Temporalties, and that the ſupreame Iuriſdiction both in temporall and ſpirituall matters, belong to Peters Succeſſors, (which was the braineleſſe aſſertion of old blockiſh Canoniſts, and exploded of all ſober Papiſts,) is now renewed, and paſſeth for Catholick Doctrine.

Reſoluing this Article therefore, we ſay; That in all the world there is but one Lordſhip, and therefore there muſt be but one Vniuerſall and Supreame Prince, and Monarke; who is Chriſts Vicar, according to that of Daniel,

                        Carerius a Doctor of Padua, in his Booke De poteſtate Romani Pontificis, which he made ſpecially to confute Bellarmine, who denied the ordinary and direct power of the Pope in the Temporalties, doth in many places and pages Pag. 9. maintaine, that all dominion as well in ſpirituall things, as in temporall, is fetcht by Chriſt, and the ſame is committed to Saint Peter and his Succeſſors: that Chriſt was Lord of all theſe inferior things, not onely as he was God, but alſo as he was Man, hauing at that time dominion in the Pag. 111. Earth: and therefore, as the dominion of the world, both diuine, and humane, was then in Chriſt, as man; ſo now it is in the Pope the vicar of Chriſt.
                     That Chriſt is directly the Lord of the world in temporall things, and therefore the Pope Chriſts vicar, is the Pag. 112. like; and this power giuen to Peter, is ſet out, by the ſole comming of Peter to Christ vpon the water, for vniuerſall Pag. 151. gouernement is ſignified by the Sea.
                     As God is the Supreme Monarke of the world, productiuely, and gubernatiuely, although of himſelfe he be Pag. 145. neither of the world, nor temporall: ſo the Pope, although originally, and from himſelfe he haue dominion ouer all things temporall, yet he hath it not by any immediate execution, and committeth that to the Emperor by an vniuerſall iuriſdiction.
                     It would weary a man to reade ouer this worke of Carerius, wherein he ſweates and toyles himſelfe, ſtriuing with arguments, and laying a curſe vpon his aduerſaries, that ſhal gainſay him, or denie the ordinary &amp; direct power of the Pope in the temporalties: which he writes, as his Vide Saund. viſib.

To omit all the reſt of

this ranke, who inclineto this opinion, That the Pope hath a direct, ordinary, and inherent power in Temporalties: let vs on the other ſide, behold theſe Madianites, or Cadmeyes Brethren, warring and wrangling with an opinionate oppoſition and contradiction.
                     The principall, and Coriphaeus of all the reſt, is the Cardinall De rom. pontif. lib. 5. c. 6. Non poteſt papa, vt papa, ordinariè temporales Principes deponere, etiam iuſta de cauſa, tanquam Iudex ordinarius, nec ordinariè iudicare de temporalibus. 
                        Bellarmine, who ouerthrowes that ordinary, direct, and inherent gouernement of the Pope in temporalties, as left by Chriſt, with ſcripturall arguments very ſoundly, and ſufficiently; yet to gratifie the Pope like a good ſeruant, he reſtraines it to limitations, and diſtinctions: Although (ſaith he) the Pope be not Lord of all Temporalties directly, neither hath inherent and ordinary authority as he is Pope, to diſthronize temporall Princes, yet he is Lord of the Temporalties indirectly, in order to the Spirituals (Bellarmines vſuall phraſe) and hath an extraordinary and a borrowed authority, as he is cheefe ſpirituall Prince, to alter Kingdomes, to take them from one, and to giue them to another, if it bee neceſſary to the ſaluation of ſoules, i. in order to the Spiritualties. Wherein obſerue how politicke theſe papall Paraſites be, diſputing about a power of Popes, in diſpoſing Temporals or Regals, one fort deriuing this power directly, and ordinarily from Chriſt, and Saint Peter; the other ſide indirectly, and onely in order to the Spirituals, when as their Pope neuer had any direct, or indirect power in that kind from God, and from Saint Peter.
                     
                     But marke how the ſonnes' of this Kingdome be diuided: The Pope hath either ordinary and direct power to depoſe Kings, as he is Pope; or he hath no authority at all, faith Carerius: But he hath no direct, and ordinary, as he is Pope, by Bellarmines opinion, Ergo, He hath none at all. Thus their diuiſion hath made a true concluſion, that their Pope hath neither ordinary, or indirect power in diſpoſition of Temporals: but leaſt Bellarmine ſhould proue an Hereticke in this point, and be vngratefull to his great Maſter the Pope, of whom he is graced with the purple hat; hee comes with his qualification, and modification,

That the Pope is Lord of the Temporalties indirectly, in order to the Spirituals; which ſtrange diſtinction hath no foundation: for Peter could Extraordinaria poteſtas non tranſit i

Thus Bellarmine hath depriued his Pope of the Temporalties, and his oppoſite Carerius hath not left him Lord of the Spiritualties: The one denies him a depoſing Pope, the other inferres vpon it, no Deputy or vicar of Chriſt; both aſſertions very true, though they deliuer them by way of altercation. Thus theſe wrangling ſpirits haue brought their Popes imaginary power in great hazard to be loſt.

For all the power of the rocke and keyes is included in binding and looſing, retaining and remitting ſinnes, as Bell. de rom. pontif. li. 1. c. 12. §. verum haec.

                        Bellarmine condemnes that, ſaying; It was neuer heard that there were more keyes in the Church then two, of Order, and of Iuriſdiction: by which aſſertion, in giuing the other Apoſtles the ſame keyes of Order and Iuriſdiction, hee confirmes our concluſion.
                     The higheſt authority that can be aſſigned, is contained in the keyes ſay Per claues ſupremam poteſtatē gubernandi eccleſiam Chriſti, &amp;c. Ianſen. concor. cap. 66. Eman. Sa.

                     The common anſwer of them is, That albeit the Apoſtles had the ſame keyes and power that Peter had, yet with a difference, that Peter had it before them, and as their Ordinary, but they after him, as his Legates and ſubiects: which is vntrue; for in the 20. of Iohn, 21. they all had their power and commiſſion from Chriſts own mouth, not from Peter: And Mark. 16. 15. Chriſt ſaid to all, Goe ye and preach the Gospell to euery creature; ſo that ſeeing they had all their Commiſſion immediatly from Chriſts mouth, it doth imply a contradiction to ſay, they had it vnder and from Peter: herein they implicate themſelues in diuers turnings: ſome Caiet. de autho. pap. &amp; concil. c 3. ſay, they receiued all their authority from Chriſt immediately, but this was becauſe it pleaſed Chriſt by ſpeciall

priuiledge to exempt them: wherein marke how they contradict themſelues: firſt ſaying, they had their authority from and vnder Peter, and preſently, they ſhould haue Oportet mendaces eſſe memores. had it, but that by ſpeciall grace they were exempted.
                     2 Sort ſay, the Apoſtles had two offices: firſt, of Apoſtleſhip: ſecondly, of Biſhoply dignity: the former they had from Chriſt; but the latter by &amp; through Peter:

                           Ʋictoria decides this power into foure parts. 1. That Peters power was ordinary, the reſt extraordinary. 2. That it was to continue in the Church, the others not. 3.

                           tan cuts it into fiue points: 1. In the manner, Peter receiued the power ordinarily, they of ſpeciall grace. 2. In the office, Peter Chriſts Vicar, they but delegates. 3. In the obiect, hauing power ouer all, they not ouer one another. 4. In continuance, Peters perpetuall; theirs determined with their life. 5. In the eſſence, Peters preceptiue to command, theirs executiue to doe what hee commanded

                     What a weake and doubtfull foundation is heere to build vp Peters Primacy, which they make an Article of their Faith, ſo inuolued with nice diſtinctions, and perplexed with difficulties, and mutuall contradictions?
                     But perchance ſome Papiſt may reply and ſay, the chiefe place to proue Peters primacy, is Iohn 20. 16. where Chriſt Cum Petro dicitur, ad omnes dicitut, amas me? paſſe oues meas. Aug. de agon. Chriſti. c. 30. ſaid thrice to Peter, Feede my Sheepe; why doth hee examine Peter of his loue more then the reſt, but that hee intended him more authority? No ſuch matter: Peter had thrice denied Chriſt, which none of the other had done; and therefore he had a threefold confirmation, and made a threefold confeſſion for his former abnegation. Oh but ſome of them haue againe argued, Feeding is ruling with fulneſſe of power, but the other Apoſtles were part of Chriſts ſheepe, therefore he muſt feede them. Anſ

                         Feeding is to edifie by the word and example, ſo Peter 
                        Gal. 2. 11. fedde the Apoſtles, and the Deus doeuit Petrum per poſteriorem Paulum. Aug. cp. 28. Apoſtles fedde Peter, as Paul fedde him at Antioch by reproofe. So all Chriſts Miniſters are commanded to feed the ſlock of Chriſt (which is as large as feed my ſheepe) but the Pope doth not thus feede the ſheepe, but rather

The gouernement of Chriſts Church is rather Ariſtocraticall, with many vnder one Chriſt, then Monarchicall vnder one viſible Head: no Primacy of power, or Iuriſdiction among the Apoſtles; if of order?

But let vs ſuppoſe; (for impoſſibilities may bee ſuppoſed) that Peter had a ſupremancy ouer the Apoſtles, or more, that Peter was Pope of Rome, how comes this ſpeciall priuiledge to the Pope? They will anſwer, by way of ſucceſſion. To which we reply, that true ſucceſſion ſtandeth in holding the ſame true faith; but the Pope departs from Peters doctrine, 1 Pet. 2. 13. 
                        Submit your ſelues vnto all manner of ordinance for the Lords ſake, whether it be vnto the King as vnto the Superiour &amp;c. Not onely Precept, but Preſident of Peter is diſliked in paying tribute for Chriſt and himſelfe: But what if Peter 
                        Math. 17. 27. was chiefe of the Apoſtles, muſt hee therefore be aboue Kings? and muſt his imagined ſucceſſor be aboue Emperors?
                     But let vs fee how the Papiſts proue Papall ſucceſſion of Peter in this imagined ſupremacy: Canus doth Locor.

                        Bellarmine acknowledges it in theſe words, Licet Romanos Epiſcopos Petro ſuccedere in ſacris lobris non habeatur, &amp;c. Although it be not written in the holy Scripture that the Romane Biſhops ſucceed Peter, yet wee haue it by Tradition from Peter.
                     
                     The Rhemiſts and many other would yet prooue it by Scripture, when as their chiefe Champion confeſſes it to Staplet. in 16. of Math. 18. be an vnwritten tradition.
                     But De Diuin. inſtitut. pontif. c. 13. 
                        Caietane proues it another way: The Pope ſucceedeth Peter in as much as he is Biſhop of Rome, and there Peter made his feate, and died at Rome. To proue this; they alledge a ſew humane ſtories ſubiect to error, as themſelues are: and I thinke it being a matter of ſo great moment as they make it, that all are damned vnleſſe they obey their Pope as Saint Peters ſucceſſor, and by vertue of this ſucceſſion beleeue his authority in matters concerning ſoule and conſcience, this life preſent and the future; it had need to be proued by pregnant places out of Scripture,

                     But I would faine be reſolued of this point by a ſchoole Papiſt, If the Pope ſucceeded Peter immediately after Peters death, who it was that ſucceeded him? whether Linus or Cletus, or Anacletus, or Clemens? it ſhall be in their choiſe to name the man.
                     
                        Clemens Romanus an old new Father, whom ſome ſay, was the Popes owne childe, writes in his Lib. 7. cap. 47. Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions, That Linus was the firſt Biſhop of Rome made by S. Paul, and that Clemens after the death of Linus was the ſecond ordained by Peter; If this relation be true, the Pope ſits not in the chaire of Peter, but in the ſeate of Paul, who appointed the firſt Pope.

                           ſtes affirme, that Linus died before Peter: heere the Cardinall contemnes theſe writers, which In Catalog. Theolog. annex. Tom. 24 controu. elſewhere hee commends for learned and Catholike Authors. In a worde, let it be granted that Clemens ſuffered theſe his competitors to liue, yet if three Popes were aliue at once, who was the true ſucceſſor of Peter, whether Lord

                        Cletus, Lord Linus, or Lord Clemens? I would faine be reſolued of this queſtion by them who ſo eagerly maintaine the Pope to haue from S. Peter his ſucceſſion: ſurely they cannot aſſoile this demand, who ſo vary among themſelues, and ſo ſtammer in their owne talke, vncertain who was the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth Pope of Rome: that the Lord Eſay 19. 2. hath done to them which hee threatned to the Egyptians; I will ſet the Egyptians againſt the Egyptians, ſo euery one ſhall fight againſt his brother, and euery one againſt his neighbour, city againſt city, and kingdom againſt kingdome, one againſt another, and God and the truth againſt them all.
                     Thus I haue a little diuerted into this point of Peters pretended ſupremacy, and the imagined ſucceſſion of Popes after him, whereupon this vſurped power ouer all, the Pope principally challenges. I know this matter hath bin largely handled by the choice Diuines of our Church, and the Papiſts haue beene put to deſperate and wofull ſhifts: I did not purpoſe to be large in it, onely but to touch it, becauſe our Lay-Papiſts haue a great fancy to it, and doe beloeue any thing, becauſe they know little or nothing; and according to Hieren. ad Nepot. 
                        Nazianzene, the rude vulgar wonder at that they doe not vnderſtand, and thinke their learned Guides prooue this very authentically, when as there is no point more weakely proued, and wherein they themſelues are more diſtracted. And but that their popiſh tutors preſume vpon their ſimplicity and ignorance, they would be aſhamed to argue thus to proue it: as firſt, Chriſt ſaid, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will I build my Church, Ergo the Church is built vpon Peter and the Pope: or againe, The gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile against the Church, Ergo, Peter and the Pope are the Church, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile; or, I haue prayed for thee Peter that thy faith faile not; Ergo, the Pope cannot erre: or, Feede my ſheepe; Ergo, Peter was the ſupreame head of the Apoſtles.
                     What a ſilly and ſimple kinde of arguing is this, voide of Diuinity and Logick, which the learned hiſſe at? which

yet goes for currant arguments among ignorant Papiſts, who in the Infancy of their knowledge haue no skill and iudgement to diſcerne theſe things; yet are ſo ouercarried, yea, infatuated with a doting fancy to beleeue any thing, which is cloaked with a pretence of Catholike Truth, or Doctrine of the Church of Rome; that with great applauſe they will accept of theſe, or the like, vnlearned follies: being like vnto that Frenchman in Geneua, of whom Epiſt. ante Miſcellan. 
                        Zanchius ſpeakes, that he proteſted, If Saint Paul and Caluin ſhould preach at the ſame houre, that he would leaue Paul and goe to Caluin. So theſe will euen deny Scripture, to beleeue, and cleaue to their Doctors; and they know how to ſeduce them well enough, making them firmely beleeue, that Peter was the Primate, and Prince of all the Apoſtles, and that the Pope ſucceeds him in all his prerogatiues, and ſits in Peters Chaire. So that we may ſay with Nicephorus. lib. 13. cap. 28.

                     How he chanced in the euening before, walking alone without the Towne of Saint Iohnſtoun, where his brother dwelt, recountred a ſuſpicious fellow, who vpon ſome conference became amazed, and his tongue faultred; and vncaſing him, wrapt vp in a cloake, and finds a great wide pot vnder his arme, full of coyned gold in great peeces: whereupon he brought the fellow backe, and priuately, without the knowledge of any man, bound him in a priuy houſe, and locked many doores vpon him, and his pot with him; and ſo haſted by foure of the clocke in the morning, to aduertiſe his Maieſty according to his duty, and deſirous that the King in his perſon priuately would bee pleaſed to behold this ſpectacle. To this perfidious Sinon the King giues a Princely audience,

Returning to him at firſt this anſwere; That hee would ſend backe with the ſaid Alexander a ſeruant of his owne, with a warrant to the Prouoſt, and Bayliffes of Saint Iohnſtoun, to receiue the alledged fellow (a man in the Moone) and the money ſuppoſed, till his further pleaſure was knowne. To be briefe: his Highneſſe importuned by the in ſinuations of this faire-ſpoken, yet falſe Iudas, reſolues Freu

(the chace being ended, and not dreaming that his Princely perſon ſhould haue beene hunted, by ſuch a fawning, yet bloody hound) to goe to Saint Iohnſtoun, to ſee with his Princely eyes the newes which this meale-mouthed Traytor had related to his Graces eares; and ſo rides thither

with a very little Trayne, and they followed after, among which was the Duke of Lennox, and the Earle of Marre. The King comming to Saint Iohnſtoun, he was met by the late Earle of Gowry, a Iudas, with an Aue Rex, and ſome three or foureſcore men accompanying him; the Kings Trayne not aboue fifteene perſons, and all vnarmed; yet his Maieſty by the way vpon occurrences of diſcourſe, and ſtupide behauiour of Alexander, requeſting the King to ſtay the Duke and Earle from following him, beganne to ſuſpect ſome treaſonable deuice. Well, the King hauing beene there partaker of a bad dinner, and the ſaid Earle ſtanding penſiue, and with a deiected countenance;

The King accompanied onely with the ſaid Alexander, goes vp a Turne-pecke through three or foure chambers, Alexander locked behind him euery doore he paſſed, (a brother to 2 Tim. 4. 14. 
                        Alexander the Copperſmith, which had done Paul much euill) vntill at laſt, his Maieſty paſſing through three or foure ſundry houſes, and all doores locked behind him by this Cerberus, his Maieſty entred into a little ſtudy, where hee ſaw ſtanding with a very abaſed countenance, not a bond man, but a free man, with a dagger at his girdle: Now mee thinkes I here that deſperate voice,

                     Behold this curſed, and Copper-Alexander, facing the King with a brazen impudence, ſaith; Now it did behoue the King to be in his will, and vſes him as he liſt; ſwearing bloody oathes, That if the King cried out, or did open a window to looke out, that dagger ſhould preſently goe to his heart.

                           Surely ſome Nero with heeles forward borne,
                           Sire to this ſlaue ſo bloody, and forlorne.
                        
                     
                     The Prou. 21. 1. Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, and he will preſerue it againſt the hands of ſuch diuelliſh Traytors. This bloody villaine opens his blacke mouth, and tels the King; That now he knew his conſcience was troubled for murthering his Father: Loe, this Caine talkes of conſcience, yet makes no conſcience to attempt to kill a moſt innocent King.
                     His Highneſſe wondring at ſo ſudden an alteration, and ſtanding naked, as an innocent Lambe before a rauenous wolfe, like the Reuel. 12. 4. woman ſtanding before the red Dragon, beginnes pathetically; and powerfully to dilate to Alexander, telling him how horrible a thing it was to meddle with his Maieſties innocent blood, a drop whereof could not bee ſhed without reuenge from Heauen, and Earth: for the Gen. 4. 10. voice of blood cries for vengeance to Heapen, and God had on Earth giuen his Highneſſe children,

and good Subiects, which would reuenge it; yea God would raiſe vp ſtockes and ſtones to puniſh ſo vile a deed: proteſting before God, that his conſcience was not troubled for the execution of his Father; he being then a Minor of age, and then guided by a Faction which ouerruled his Maieſty &amp; the reſt of the Country, and what was done to his Father, was done by the common courſe of Law &amp; Iuſtice: Appealing to the ſaid Alexanders owne conſcience (a ſinfull and ſeared conſcience) how well his Grace had at all times ſince deſerued at the hands of all his race, reſtoring them to their lands and dignities, freely and voluntarily of his regall clemency, bringing vp two or three ofhis ſiſters, as it were in his owne boſome, by a continuall attendance vpon his deareſt bedfellow in her priuy Chamber: and if all theſe had beene too little, he would haue giuen him, as it was ſaid to Dauid, ſuch, and ſuch things: but here in them verified, which Sen. Epiſt. 48. 
                        Seneca deliuered, Quidam, quô plus debent, magis oderunt, &amp;c. Certaine men being bound to loue for ſome benefits, rather the more beginne to hate: Quid autem miſerius, (ſaith the ſame wiſe man) cui beneficia dantur, gratias agere iniurijs; What more wretched thing, then hauing receiued benefits, to reward the giuer with iniuries? Theſe are Eſops Snakes.
                     His Maieſty promiſed him on the word of a Prince, that if he would ſpare his life, (a Soueraigne a ſuppliant to a ſubiect an abiect, begges mercy of this miſcreant, to ſpare his life) hee would neuer reucale it to any fleſh liuing, what was betwixt them at that time, nor neuer ſuffer him to incurre any harme, or puniſhment for the ſame: A ſpeech able to make a Cannibals heart to relent, being vttered with ſuch feeling as accompanies ſuch feares. This his Maieſties perſwaſiue language ſome what amazed and calmed this terrible and truculent Traytor, ſo that hee ſwore the Kings life ſhould bee ſafe, if hee would behaue himſelfe quietly, without noyſe, or crying; and that hee would goe downe, and bring in his brother the Earle to ſpeake with his Maieſty; And ſo goes downe, and lockes the doore after him, leauing his Maieſty with that man

was there before, whom this Alexander appointed the Kings Keeper till his returne.
                     Then his Maieſtie demanded of that man, who was a ſeruant to the late Earle of Gowrie, &amp; his name Andrew Henderſon, whether he was appointed to be the murderer of him, and how far he was vpon the counſell of that conſpiracy; who with a trembling, and aſtoniſhed voice, and behauiour, anſwered with ſolemne and deepe proteſtations, that he was neuer acquainted with that purpoſe, being put in there perforce, and the doore locked vpon him: and indeede all the time of Alexanders menacing the King, this Henderſon trembled, and requeſted him for Gods ſake, not to doe the King any harme. The King commands him to open the window on his right hand, which hee did: for Alexander had made the King ſweare not to cry out, nor open any window.
                     Wherein behold the miraculous prouidence of almighty God, that he who was put in there to vſe violence on the King, ſhould be an Inſtrument for the Kings ſafety, &amp; vppon Dan. 5. 6. the ſight of the King, as Belſhazzar did, when he ſaw the hand writing on the wall, trembling and quaking, rather like one condemned, then an executioner of ſuch an enterprize. VVhile the King was all this while like Dan. 6. 16. 
                        Daniel in a Lyons den, and by the 2 Tim. 4. 17. Lord ſo aſſiſted &amp; ſtrengthened, that afterward hee was deliuered like Paul out of the mouth of the Lyon; his Maieſties Trayne riſing from dinner, the Earle of Gowry with them, one of the Earle of Gowries ſeruants comes haſtily, ſaying; His Maieſty is horſed, and away through the Inſhe; which the Earle reporting to the Noblemen, and the reſt, all ruſh forth in great haſte; and enquiring of the Porter which way his Maieſty went, the Porter affirmed, the King was not yet gone: whereupon this Gowry reuiles the Porter, and turning to the Duke, and Earle of Marre, ſaid; He would preſently get certaine word, whether the King was gone, or no? and ſo ranne through a cloſe, and vp the ſtaires; hauing a purpoſe to ſpeake with his Brother. Preſently the Earle returnes, and runnes to the Noblemen, telling them the

King was gone out at the backe gate, to which place all of them repaired.
                     This inhumane wretch Alexander hauing had a little pawſe and parly with his bloudy brother, comes backe againe to the King;

                     Therefore this treacherous Philiſtine comes with a garter to binde our Soueraigne (as the Iudg. 16. 21. Bis mori eſt, alteri

                        Abimelech held diſhonourable, and therefore willed his Page to runne him through with his ſword: he muſt not die fighting cominus &amp; eminus, hand to hand; but hee would haue him die as a condemned Malefactor, or as a Prou. 7. 22. foole goeth to the ſtockes, bound hand and foote, though hee ruled with glory, yet goe to his graue with ignominy. It behoueth you to be bound, ſaith this abhorred wretch; but died 2 Sam. 3. 33. 34. 
                        Abner as a foole dieth? Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet tied in fetters of braſſe, but as a man falleth before wicked men, ſo didſt thou fall.
                     His Maieſty hearing this villaine talke of binding, ſaid he was borne a free King, and ſhould die a free King. Beholde the worke of the Lord, animating our King Iames

God and his Angels beheld this fray, and heard the ſecret petition of our Soueraignes ſoule, Pſal. 7. 1. 2.

In this ſtrugling the King perforce drew him to the window which Henderſon before opened, and vnder the which paſſed (O rare &amp; moſt ſingular prouidence of God) the Kings traine, and the Earle of Gowrie with them: The King holding out the right ſide of his head, and right elbowe, cryed, They were murdering him:

                     In the meane time, his Maieſty with ſtriuing and ſtrugling with this baſe Traytor—impar congreſſus Achilli; had brought him perforce out of the ſtudy, the dore being open, and got Alexanders head vnder his arme, and himſelfe on his knees, his Maieſty driuing him backe perforce hard to the doore of the ſame turne-pecke: and as his Maieſty was throwing his ſword out of his hand, thinking to haue ſtricken him therewith, and ſhot him ouer the ſtaire, the other fellow Henderſon, ſtanding behinde the Kings backe, and doing nothing but trembling all the time; that euer-honoured man Sir Iohn Ramſey, now meritoriouſly graced with more noble titles, finds the turne-pecke dore open, followes it vp to the head, the firſt that did enter into the chamber to helpe the King.
                     
                        
                           Ʋirg

                     As the Poet of Laocoon; it was his happy fortune to haue that glory, and the King his firſt helpe: they are very happy ſubiects that are a meanes to preſerue Kings from traitors; for therein they ſtand in ſtead of Gods Angels. This valiant and noble Lord inſtantly tooke his dagger, &amp; ſtrikes Alexander twice or thrice, his Maieſty ſtil keeping his hold on this traytor: and immediately this Alexander by the ſhoulder taken, and ſhot downe the ſtaire; who no ſooner was ſhot out of the doore, but hee was met by Sir Thomas Erskinne, who ended this vile wretch, and traytor there: a iuſt puniſhment for ſo bloudy a miſcreant, who attempted to kill the Lords Annointed. This Arch traytor may well bee placed in the blacke Calendar of bloudy traitors

in the firſt ranke, whoſe name is odious and infamous to the whole world.
                     Thus the King being thus happily preſerued from the aſſault of this butcherly Aſſaſinate, and Sir Hugh Hereis, Sir Thomas Erskins, and one Wilſon, being got into the Chamber where the King was; inſtantly before they could get the doore ſhut, comes the inſolent and bloudy-minded Earle Gowry, hauing a drawen ſword in each hand, and a ſteele bonnet on his head, accompanied with 7. of his ſeruants, hauing each a drawen ſword; the Earle at his ſirſtentry cryed out with a great oath, They ſhould all dye as Traytors. The King ſeeing the Earle come in with ſwords in his hands, ſought for Alexanders ſword, hauing no ſort of weapons of his owne, But the loyall loue, and immortall fidelity of his true Subiects there, rather deſirous to hazard their liues in the fortune of that fight, then any more to endanger the King, gat him backe into the little ſtudy, and the doore ſhut vpon him, and ſo put him in ſafety, re-encountred the Traytor Earle and his ſeruants, where after many blowes on all hands, it pleaſed God in his great power and pitty, to giue his Maieſties ſeruants the victory; Sir Iohn Ranſey did ſtrike dead with a thruſt through the heart the Traytor Earle, the ſhame of Nobility, and ſcandall to Chriſtianity: who as hee liued wretched, addicted to Necromancers, and after his death had in his pocket found Magicall Characters and words of enchantment: ſo at his laſt gaſpe neuer named God; vix bene moritur, quimale vixit, as De Doctr. Chriſtiana. 
                        Auſten: much more in this caſe, he cannot die well who liued ſo ill, who did ſo ill, and died ſo ill; yet I may not touch his eternall doome, onely ſay with Cicero, 
                        Cicero in Paradex.

                           s, quorum cum vita omnia extinguuntur, Death is terrible vnto them, with whoſe life al things be extinguiſhed: for all temporal things loſt with him, his heyres by Act of Parliament depriued for euer of his eſtate, name, ſame, and fortunes goods with him from his for euer vaniſhed. The reſt of the confederates in this fray were dung ouer the ſtaires with many hurts; as alſo Sir Iohn Ramſey, Sir Thomas Erskin, Sir Hugh Hereis, (a

true Triumviri of right Noble, Valiant, and ſpirited Knights, famous for euer for this ſeruice) were ſore wounded in this chamber-conflict: yet they grudged not their bloud, had it beene ſpent to the laſt droppe in ſo good a cauſe, for the defence of the King being in ſo perillous extremity. But all the time of this fight, the Duke of Lennox, and Earle of Marre, and the reſt of the Court were ſtriking with great hammers at the vtter doore, where his Maieſty paſſed vp to the Chamber, and beeing a double doore could not bee broken open the ſpace of halfe an houre and more; ſo that though their faithfull hearts and feruent prayers poured out to God for the King, which were effectuall to helpe in this perill, yet their hands could not, as they all deſired, be preſent in this ſeruice. But hauing at laſt made a way, and finding his Maieſty (beyond their expectation) deliuered from ſo imminent a death, and the chiefe conſpirators ſlaine, infinitely reioyced. And his Maieſty immediately kneeling downe on his knees in the middeſt of them, did moſt heartily praiſe the Lord for his deliuery, aſſuring himſelfe that God had preſerued him from ſo deſpaired a perill, for the perfecting of ſome greater worke, for the glory of God, and good of his ſubiects committed to his charge.
                     Thus I haue ſet downe the chiefe ſubſtance of the ſtory of this conſpiracy, and the manner of the Kings deliuery, with the two chiefe Traitors death and tragedy. Vnneceſſary it is for mee to recite the end of Bour and Logane, &amp;c. conſpirators dead and deuoured of wormes, whoſe memoriall is periſhed with them: onely behold the power and prouidence of God in opening the mouth of Sprott, haling him to the Miniſters of Iuſtice, and cauſing him to bee his owne accuſer eight yeares after, when no mortall creature could detect him (all the confederates dead) except the guilty conſcience of his owne breaſt. And as Lib. de moribus.

                        Conſcientia mala, bona ſperare non poteſt. What the vltimate end was which Gowrie aymed at, it is not knowne certainely; yet ſure he looked for more then the life of an innocent King, &amp; proiected more then the bare reuenge of his Fathers death; his trauelling into Italy, into thoſe parts where they would giue ſundry folkes Breues, as his follower Rinde confeſſed; his intimate conference with Ieſuites, men dangerous to Kings and States, his plauſibility with the people (an harbinger of ambitious thoughts;) Theſe with other practiſes hee vſed, as being addicted to Magiche, are like the bleating of 1 Sam. 15. 14. ſheepe in Samuels eares, and may all ſay, What meane theſe things? wee may coniecture ſomething, yet determine nothing: for this Traytor was a Politician who held this Maxime; Rinde doth relate it in his re-examination. That he was not a wiſeman, who hauing intended the execution of an high and dangerous purpoſe; did communicate the ſame to any but himſelfe.
                     Thus we ſee how the Lord verifies Dauids words; Pſal. 37. 28. 
                        Hee forſaketh not his Saints, they ſhall be preſerued for euermore, but the ſeed of the wicked ſhall be cut off.

And if all antiquity ſhould awake, it could not relate a more Diuine deliuery in ſo dangerous and deadly extremity. And it doth miniſter immortall and immatchable motiues of perpetuall praiſes, and thankeſ giuing to God: to ſing with 145. 3. 4. 
                        Dauid, Great is the Lord, and moſt worthy to be praiſed, and his greatneſſe is incomprehenſible: Generation ſhall praiſe thy workes vnto generation, and declare thy power. The Lord preſerueth all them that loue him, but he

Wherein his Holineſſe exhorteth you to continue, and to bring to paſſe your promiſe: and that you may be the better ayded by that good Spirit, which hath induced you to this, his Bleſſedneſſe grants you full pardon, and forgiueneſſe of your ſinnes, and his Holineſſe will further make himſelfe a debtor to you, to acknowledge your deſeruings in the beſt maner he may: put in act your holy, and honorable thoughts, and looke to your ſafety: and I wiſh you all good, and happy ſucceſſe: from Rome. 30. of Ianuarie. 1584.

                        Ego Pompeij caſum deploro, &amp; meam fortunā metuo I lament Pompeys fall, and feare mine owne fortune: but the enemies of Sion, as they haue Crocodile eyes to weepe and laugh at murthered obiects, ſo they haue deuouring mouthes, and teeth to water after ſuch preyes. I will not iudge all of them to be of ſo bloody a diſpoſition: for I preſume ſome Ieſuites, and Prieſts, and Monkes, are like Aristippus, looke for nothing but meat for their belly, and a maide for their bed; little buſie their braines with other matterrs: or ſome may follow their ſtudy, which yet is not vſuall, eſpecially among the ſecular Prieſts, whom the Quodlibet 1.

                     Another policy they had pretended, appointing an hunting match againſt the time of this treacherous deſigne, thinking with Eſau to haue brought dainty Veniſon to their Father, not Iſaacke, but Antichriſt, and to haue ſurprized the perſon of the Lady Elizabeth (now the Princely wife to the County Palatine of Rheine): Thus they ſhewed themſelues right Nimrods,

                     But to paſſe ouer their policy in this worke of impiety, painted ouer vnder a pretence of reſtauration of religion: Is murder and maſſacres the ſeed of Rome, from which theſe ſeedes-men would fetch Religion? will the darnell of death produce the ſeed of life? For the publike good Gods ſeruants haue wiſhed themſelues to be anathematized, but

neuer others. Can Gods Church be wonne, or woed with ſwords, and armes? Indeed Phil oſtratus. 
                        Phillip of Macedon led an Army againſt Bizantium, and ſaid; that hearing of the beauty of the City, he was come to make loue to her: but the Otator tels him, It was not the manner of Louers to wooe with inſtruments of warre, but muſicke. The City of Gods Church will be wonne with no warlike Engines, the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, 2 Cor. 10. 4. ſaith Paul; The Church of Chriſt was neuer planted by blood, except paſſiuely; and ſo Tertullian.

Mount Gerizim, to Mount Eball, to curſe, and conſume all. It is a weighty and worthy worke to plant the Goſpell, the glad tidings of peace, and no better way to doe it, then by prayers and peace: but in this worke the Papiſts euer vſed the wrong toole, labouring Theologi Romani argumenta ferrea, &amp; ignea Spirant, nō Scripta atramento, ſed Sanguine. to make men Haeredes vineae, exhaeredes vitae: Diſpoſſeſſe them of life here, howſoeuer hereafter.

If theſe men were ſo confident of the truth of their Religion (and none more confident then the ignorant) why did they not follow the Counſell of truth it ſelfe, Math. 10. 23. if they perſecute you in this City, flie into another: yet they had no cauſe to ſay ſo truly; why did they not forſake all, and flie to Rome? there were their hearts, what did their bodies here? or if

Valedicere jis qui domi ſunt with him, they would firſt kiſſe their Father and Mother, before they would follow Chriſt, had a naturall affection to the things on earth; yet why were they not willing with the Apoſtles to ſubmit themſelues to the higher Powers in bodily obedience, but in ſpirituall ſeruice, to ſay with Acts 4. 19. 
                        Peter and Iohn; Whether it be right in the ſight of God to obey you, rather then God, iudge ye.
                     
                        
But how comes it to paſſe, that ſuch Lay-Papiſts of ſmall knowledge, and leſſe grace, ſhould take vpon them to be reformers of Religion? Were they extraordinarily called to this worke, as Iudg. 3. 15. 21. 
                        Ehud was to be a Sauiour to Iſrael, in deſtroying King Eglon; or as 2. King. 9. &amp; 10. 
                        Iehu in killing Ioram, and the ſtocke of Achab? had the Lord ſaid vnto them, as to Ioſhua,

I know whoſe iudgement it muſt paſſe, yet am feareleſſe: not in a groſſe ſtupidity of mine owne weakeneſſe, but in an hopefull preſumption of your vſuall Gentleneſſe: a diſpoſition euen naturalized in your courteous breaſts, whereof I acknowledge with gratefulneſſe the acceptable fruites of your long, and large loue towards me, and for which I euer reſt your thankefull friend, and ingaged debtor: in part of requitall whereof, I haue preſumed to offer to you this Handfull of my duty, and hearty loue towards you, and vnder your worthy name to ſend it to the world, that they who are bettered by it, may thanke you for it. A ſhort Diſſwaſiue from Popery, neceſſary for theſe Times,

wherein you may behold in part ſome points of the corrupt Doctrine of the Romiſh Church, which is the common Mother of corruption &amp; ſuperſtition: For that Church muſt needes be a Chappell of errors, which enlarge the ſacred Canon with Adferunt haeretici Apocryphorum Librorum multitudinem, vt ſtupefaciant amentes, &amp;c.

Popery is a witchcraft of religion, teaching her people to eate their God, kill their King, ſubuert the Scriptures, adore Idols, Deifie the dead, equalize their Pope with God, &amp;c. the authority of the Scripture with Traditions, ouerthrow the Originall with Tranſlations, &amp; peruert the Text with Gloſſes: as the Romiſh Church doth. Yea to maintaine her errors, ſhe conceales the light of Truth, the Scripture, from Lay people vnder the curtaine of the Latin language; and euen in the Schooles among the learned ſhe is put to poore ſhifts, often forced to conclude arguments out of meere Allegories, lame Similitudes, fained miracles, naked names of Fathers, hired Teſtimonies of Schoolemen, and other deboſhed vaſſailes and proctors of the Romane Court, who with all artificiall pollicy labour to adorne the Romane Harlot with painted trimmings, whereby the vnwary young age of many (more credulous, then iudicious) is deceiued, and deluded. The whole ſubiect of our former worke, well peruſed, and indifferently weighed, doth giue good light (looking vpon her corrupt precepts, and curſed practiſes) to diſcouer that ſmooky Kingdome of Antichriſt: but perchance you may ſay to me with Seneca,

                  The attractiue motiues which draw many to fancy and follow the religion of the Church of Rome, may be reduced to three Heads. 1. The Antiquitie: 2. The Vniuerſality: 3. The Vnity of that Church: which three (if they could be found there) were of powerfull conſequence to mooue reuerence; but neither of theſe can be found there: for the moderne Romane Church, which coines ſo often new Bulla Pij 4. Super forma iuramenti profeſſionis fidei. Creedes, and Articles of faith, and is reuolted from herſelfe in ſubſtance of doctrine, is no more like herſelfe in her primitiue State, then Lais the Curtizan is an honeſt woman. I could demonſtrate this I ſay without controulement, if I were purpoſed to write a common-place-booke of Controuerſies in this point; but it hath beene handled ſo largely, and learnedly by other Diuines of our Church, The Church of Rome is ancient, not her errors: neither doe wee differ from it, wherein it is not departed from it ſelfe. that I may at this time forbeare any long diſcourſe. I will but touch it: and inſtance this I write, how the moderne Church of Rome is ſwarued from herſelfe, not onely from the Truth, which primitiue Rome embraced, but alſo varied from herſelfe, declining into hereſie, innouating thoſe Articles, and dogmaticall points of faith (as they count

them) which in the proceſſe of her fall ſhe profeſſed: it might be ſpecified in moſt of the points of Doctrine ſhe maintaines at this preſent time, but I will reſt with theſe few, for I write but an Epitome.
                  
                     1 Example ſhall be in the Sacrament.
                     At Geo: Caſſand. defen: lib. de offic: Pij viri. the firſt the people receiued the cup, as well as the bread, for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres: yea, afterward, the Romance Church commanded the wine to be conſecrated, that the lay-people might fully communicate, ſaith Lib. de Eccle. obſeruat. c. 19. pag. 388. 
                        Micrologus: moſt and the beſt Papiſts liked this well, that the people ſhould communicate in both kinds; but afterward, the Councell of Seſſ. 13. §. item ipſa. 
                        Conſtance forbad it, and after that, the Councell of

                     So that this point of Doctrine, now maintained in the Church of Rome, can pleade no antiquity, being now ſo oft renewed, put vp, and put downe; and their moſt ancient Liturgies ſhew, how the people receiued the wine, as well as the bread: and this cuſtome (ſaith 3 Part.

                     2 Example in Tranſubſtantiation.
                     Tranſubſtantiation lately brought into the Church, and made a matter of faith by a ſilly Pope Innocent the third, in the Lateran Councell, within theſe 400 yeeres: and the Soto. 4. d. 9. q. 2. Art. &amp; 4. Suar. tom. 3. d. 5. §. 1.

                        ſerpit, as Eſpencaeus; creepes ſtealing like a Canker, infects one part, then another. Such hath beene the malady of the Church of Rome, their creeping corruptions canker-like, firſt one part, then another point, that it is hard to ſet downe the preciſe time, when theſe corruptions ingendered. The Greekes debated long on this probleme: The ſhip Argos, wherin Iaſon ſayled for the golden Flecce, after the Plutarke. voyage ended, was laied vp in the roade for a Monument: where decaying by degrees, it was repaired by peeces anew; in the end, the whole ſubſtance of the veſſell extinct, and nothing left, but onely the reparations ſucceſſiuely made. Now the queſtion was, whether-this ſhip (ſuppoſe it Peters) were the ſame that he ſayled in when he liued, or an other renewed? and whether can any man tell, when ſuch a peece was added, ſuch a part ſupplied? And if this cannot be ſo preciſely ſhewed, doth it follow infallibly,

that it was the very Argoſie: wherein Iaſon ſayled? So in this caſe, their ſhip, their Church, ſo often peeced, ſo many new points added, euery Pope almoſt changing his Predeceſſors decrees, abrogating this point, and augmenting it with another, that it is indeed a new ſhip, and can iuſtly pleade no great antiquity.
                     And for vniuerſality, and vnity in Doctrine, no Church ſo much diuided.

                        Baronius ſaith, that a notable ſtrumpet to Adelbert Marqueſſe of Tuſcia, proſtituting her daughters to the Popes, did create Popes at the pleaſure of the ſtrumpets: and he cries An. 912. n. 8. out: How filthy was the face of the Romane

Church then, when moſt powerfull, and withall moſt ſordide whores bare all the ſway at Rome, and their louers were thruſt into Peters ſeate? At this day (as wee reade) the Pope hath a penſion from the ſtewes at Rome; Were he like Peter, he would abhorre to foule his hands with ſuch ſtinking gaine, or enrich his coffers with an harlots hire: rather Acts 8. 20. with S. Peter ſay, Thymony periſh with thee: or with our Sauiour to the women taken in adultery, Iohn 8. 11. Goe away and ſinne no more; and not to giue them a toleration or diſpenſation for fornication.
                     To leaue this point, as the Poet left Rome, with this verſe:

                           Roma vale, vidi, ſatis eſt vidiſſe, reuertar,
                           Cum leno, meretrix, ſcarra, cinaedus ero.
                         
                        
                           Oh Rome farewell, I haue ſeene, and ſeene too much,
                           Returne I will, when turne, baud, whore, or ſuch.
                        
                     
                     The third marke may be this, That there is no point of our faith, but many learned in the Church of Rome approue 3 Marke. the ſame; and no point of Papiſtry by vs confuted, but ſome of the chiefe of their Church haue diſliked, as well as we; that we may ſay to them as our Sauiour did to that bad ſeruant, Luk. 19. 22. The Papiſts find this ttue, &amp; therfore haue purged the elder Papiſts books, &amp; corrected thoſe points, or wholly razed them out. Vide Indic. libr. prohibit. p. 25. §. 3. 
                        Ex ore tuo te iudico, of thine owne mouth will I condemne thee. Thus the diuiſion of the tongues and people of Babilon are a meanes of the plantation and edification of Gods Ieruſalem. This point hath beene demonſtrated in the chiefe queſtions betwixt them and vs, by many learned Diuines of our Church, and excellently verified and declared by Doctor Morton, a ſingular ornament of our Church, in many of his workes, but eſpecially in his firſt and ſecond part of his Catholicke Apology, wherein he hath ouerthrown the points of Popery of the chiefeſt difference by the affirmations and aſſertions of the beſt learned Papiſts, to whoſe labour in this point I refer the iudicious Reader.
                     The fourth marke is this: That many maine points in 4 Marke. popery are abſurd, and euen againſt common ſenſe, and the light of nature.
                     
                        
What man endewed with mother-wit, can perſwade himſelfe, that the Pope is Iudge and Lord ouer the Scripture, Church, Councels, and all the world: and that in his breaſt there is an infallibility of not erring, when as common and continuall experience ſpeakes the contrary?
                     What likelihood is there in the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, Corpus Chriſti, nec in quantum corpus, nec in quantū vnitum diuinitati hoc habet, vt ſit in pluribꝰ locis ſimul. Aquinas diſt. 27. qu. 1. Vis excidere gratia? acta tua merita.

                     What colour of trueth can there be in the doctrine of workes of Superogation, that a man can merit more then is needfull for him, and that this his ouer-plus of obedience, by the Churches diſpenſation, is beneficiall to other, who want this plenitude? when as our Luk. 17. 10. Beggars crauing an almes ſhew their wounds, &amp; wants, but Papiſts their works to chalenge heauen as a debt. Idem eſt fingere multos deos, &amp; ſanctos mortuos inuocare Melancthō.

                     How repugnant to a good mans reaſon is their popiſh equiuocation, to diſſemble the truth with a mentall reſeruation.

How doe they follow the counſell of 1 Pet. 2. 1. 
                        Peter (of whom they boaſt) who commands them to lay aſide al diſſimulation: or as S. Eph. 4. 25.

                     Not to touch all the fringes or fragments belonging to this whore, wherewith ſhe is apparelled, I will but handle foure of her relickes, foure points of popery, which in my weake apprehenſion are diſlonant to common reaſon, much more to Chriſtian religion.
                     1. Her Latin ſeruice: 2. implicit faith. 3. worſhipping I will a littlelook vpon, ſcarce touch the poyſonous pommell of the chaire of peſtilence. of Images. 4.

                     1. Popiſh Latin ſeruice.
                     What poſſibility is there that Seruice or Praiers ſaid in a tongue which the people vnderſtand not ſhould be profitable to them? As the 1 Cor. 14. 14. 19. Apoſtle, If I pray in a ſtrange tongue, my vnderſtanding is without fruit: and the ſame Apoſtle, I had rather in the Church to ſpeake fiue wordes with my vnderſtanding, then tenne thouſand wordes in a ſtrange tongue: and againe, Except ye vtter words that Cap. 9. haue ſignification, how ſhall it be vnderſtood what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall ſpeake in the aire, and the Apoſtle ſeemes vpon purpoſe in the whole chapter to condemne this

                     To pray in an vnknowne tongue, is not to pray, but to prate like a Parrot: and yet the Tridentine Seſſ. 22. c. 8. Councell decreed, Non expedire vt diuinum officium vulgari paſſim lingua

                     Yea themſelues Hard. art. 3. ſect. 28. confeſſe, That in the time of the Primitiue Church the people in the vulgar tongue did celebrate their diuine ſeruice: In primitiue eccleſia benedictiones, &amp; caetera communia fiebant invulgari, ſaith Lyranus in the Primitiue Church benedictions, and other common duties done in the vulgar tongue: nay Bel. lib. 2. de verb.

                        Bellarmine goes further, Longo tempore poſt, tempore Chryſoſtomi, ac Cypriani, ac Ieronymi, ea conſuetudo valuit, long after that, in the time of Chryſoſtome, Cyprian, and Ierome, this cuſtome, to celebrate ſacred things in the vulgar tongue, preuailed.
                     The cauſe which the Trent Seſſ. 22. c. 1. Councell alleadgeth, why all diuine ſeruice ſhould bee in the Latin tongue, is this, mos generalis eccleſiae habet, vt tantum tribus linguis, hebraica, Graeca, &amp; latina celebretur, The generall cuſtome of the Church hath beene, that in theſe three tongues, Hebrue, Greeke, and Latin, it ſhould bee celebrated: In the Primitiue Church and long after, no ſuch cuſtome, by their owne confeſſion: and if any tongue, rather the Hebrue, the moſt ancient; but the Hebrue and Greeke originals of the Scripture are by them little regarded, and the vulgar Latin tranſlation of the Scripture is by the Councell of Seſſ. 4. Trent canonized, charging all to vſe it, as the authenticall text in all their readings, diſputations, ſermons, and expoſitions, and that they doe not reiect it vpon any pretence whatſoeuer. Yea the F. Simen. bibl. Complut. in prolog. Biſhop of Toledo putting forth the Bible in diuers languages, printed the Latin betweene the Hebrue and Greeke, ſaying, hee had placed them as the two theeues on eyther ſide, but the Romane, or Latin put in the midſt betweene them, as Ieſus Chriſt: and yet I thinke neuer did the ſunne ſee any thing more

defectiue and maimed then the vulgar Latin thus by them extolled. I could with my finger point at groſſe corruptions therein, but I may ſpare that labor, their own tongues ſhall tell it. Their owne Biſhop 
                           De opt. gent interpret li. 3. c. 1. 2. 4. 6. We acknowledge that there be many faults in our Latin edition of the bible, &amp;c. Sixt Senen. bibl. ſanct. lib. 8. p. 365. 
                        Lindan ſaith, it hath monſtrous corruptions of all ſorts, ſcarce one coppy hath one booke of Scripture vndefiled: many points tranſlated improperly, abuſiuely: with many other learned Papiſts, who might be named, complaining of ſeuerall additions, detractions, falſifications, deprauations, and barbariſmes of the vulgar Latine, now by them preferred aboue the Hebrue and Greeke coppies.
                     Well, if the Lay people may haue this Latin Bible read vnto them, yet vnderſtand neuer a worde of it, and other Church prayers, they thinke this ſeruice is ſufficient which is but a little better then vox porcorum, or mugitus boum, then crying of hogges, or the bellowing of buls: for it is the compariſon of De ſummo bono, lib 3. c. 8. 
                        Iſidorus, Quid poteſt ſtrepitus labiorum vbi cor eſt mutum? oratio ſine deuotione, est quaſi mugitus boum, what is the ſound of the lips, the heart ſilent? Prayer without deuotion is like the roring of oxen: what deuotion or feeling is in that minde which is ſenſeleſſe of the wordes of his mouth? a ſenſeleſſe petitioner, who vnderſtands not the ſenſe of his petition. If a wauering minded man ſhall receiue nothing of the Lord, as Iam. 1. 7. 
                        Iames, what ſhall a filly ſot obtaine, who is both inconſtant and ignorant how to pray, and what to pray for? his Pater noster &amp;c, or Credo indeum will ſtand him in ſmall flead: Sathan Let euery man make his prayer to God in his natiue tongue. Origen. contra Celſum, lib. 8. in all his ſhop of fraud hath not a craftier guile to erect his kingdome of iniquity, then this accurſed pollicy: Therefore let all men who feare God and deſire his fauour to heare their prayers, follow S.

                     The Church of Rome which rockes her children in the cradle of ignorance, tells them implicite faith is ſufficient for them which is the faith of Aſſes, as images are fit bookes for Idiots. The deſcription of implicit faith I will fetch from themſelues who know beſt the true image of

this their falſe Idoll: Implicita fides eſt credere, ſecundum quod credit Eccleſia, vnde non omnis Chriſtianus tenetur illos articulos fidei ſcire explicite, ſed tantum clerici, ſaith their Iacob. de Graff. deciſ. lib. 2. ca. 8. nu. 16. owne writer, Implicite or infold faith is to belieue as the Church beleeues, ſo that it is not neceſſary for euery Chriſtian to know thoſe Articles of faith explicitely, but onely Prieſts: a ſtrange faith, onely deuiſed to ſuppreſſe knowledge, and to countenance ignorance: ſo Bell. de Juſtif. lib.

                        Staphilus relates at large a Colliars faith, which Colliar at the point of death, and tempted of the Deuill, to know his Beliefe, ſayd, I belieue, and die in the faith of Chriſts Church: vrged againe, what the faith of Chriſts Church was? anſwered. That faith that I belieue in. Thus the Deuill receiuing no other anſwer was vanquiſhed. This implicite faith, rather fancy, is that folly which they would haue their laity to loue, excluding knowledge from the nature of faith, and make a naked Aſſent ſufficient for ſaluation. Thus theſe Soule-thiefes doe not onely put out the Candle of knowledge, the Scripture, and put it vnder a Buſhell, leaſt it ſhould deſcry them, but would extinguiſh all light of grace, their Creede, which doth condemne them: To belieue as others belieue, or as the Church belieues, and yet know not the beliefe of the Church: a purblind faith to ſaue the blind.
                     They teach the people not to trouble themſelues with ſearching into the miſteries of Chriſtian religion, or points of faith, but ſay, (as their Rhem. annot. Luke 
                              •
                           2. 11. Rhemiſts tutor them) that they will liue, and dye in that faith which the Catholicke Church teaches, and this Church can giue a reaſon of the things belieued: a very quicke way, if it were a good way: but God requires a diſtinct knowledge of the points of our faith, to be able, and 1. Pet. 3. 15. ready alwayes to giue an anſwere to euery man that asketh a reaſon of our hope, and faith: not

to haue the particular knowledge of our faith locked vp in the Church-cheſt, but in our owne breaſt: not to ſend to Rome, or the Pope for an anſwere, to ground their faith on, for they may be dead, before their meſſage be deliuered, or an anſwere returned.
                     This implicite faith was in no requeſt in Dial. cum Tryph.

It is expounded to them, may ſome ſay: Worthily I doe warrant you: when as many of their Prieſts, and ſome of their Popes could not be Latin expounders.

                        Bellarmine explaines it further, This honor is ſo giuen, that the Image ſtayeth, and limiteth it in it ſelfe, as it is an Image, and not onely as it repreſenteth the ſamplar. 3 Is Tom. 4. 345.

Yet no way to be worſhipped, for we deny the Reall preſence corporally, as they affirme: and it is very ſtrange, that they ſhould adore that, who teach, that Cautelae miſſae. a man hauing receiued his maker, may vomit him vp againe: or as Tho. 3. q. 80. art. 3. ad 3.

                     Though we doe not adore the bread and wine, yet we giue more reuerence to it, and teach, that the wicked may take panem Domini, the Bread of the Lord, not panem Dominum, the Lord as Bread, ſauingly participate this ſacred myſtery of the Redemption by the body and blood of leſus Chriſt.
                     So that to conclude this point, If it be vnlawfull pingere imaginem Dei in forma hominis, to draw the Image of God in the likeneſſe of man for which their De Eccl. Trium. c. 8. § haec opinio.

that to ſuch, God will ſay, as the Pſal. 97. 7. Prophet ſpeakes, Confounded be all they that ſerue grauen images, or that glory in Idolles: and as Eſay 42. 8. 
                        Eſay. I am the Lord, this is my name, and my glory will I not giue to an other, neither my praiſe to grauen Images.
                     And I wonder that any ſhould be ſo bewitched as to delight in Images (hiſtoricall vſel deny not, but all ſpirituall vſe is fornication, and abomination:) but more to creepe, and croutch to them, the viſible obiects of duſt, or dirt, to Eſay 44. 19. bowe to the ſtocke of a Tree, as the Prophet ſpeakes, this is the baſeſt thing that almoſt the Sunne euer ſawe, vnworthy of man, whoſe knee ſhould bow to his Maker, and not to the ſtocke that he hath made himſelfe: how odious is the ſeruice, and ſacrifice of ſuch creeping and croutching Idoll-ſuppliants in the Lords ſight? he will Malaeh: 2: 3: caſt the dung vpon their owne faces, euen the dung of their ſolemne feaſts, ſuch fordide ſeruice, ſuch prophane, and heatheniſh ſacrifice, which ſtinckes in his noſtrills, and ſay, I neuer required this woodden worſhip at your hands, I neuer commanded you to buy theſe Bookes, which you ſay, ſhall put you in remembrance of me; but you that cannot remember me without the ſight of an Image on earth, I will forget you, and ſhall neuer haue a ſight of my Image in heauen.

                     Indeede when it pleaſed the Lord to open Luthers eyes to ſee the truth, he began firſt to finde fault with the baſe inundation of picke-purſe pardons, though (as hee ſaith) then he did but fight in the darke: for when Pope Leo the tenth had ſent abroad his pardons which were preached by Terelius a Dominicke Frier', Luther admoniſhed the people of the abuſes and deceits of the pardons and pardoners, which long before his time had beene reproued in the Councels of Lateran and Vienna: and complained to the Archbiſhop of Mentz, to the Biſhop of Brandenburg, to the Prouinciall of the Auguſtine Friers, and to the Pope himſelfe: and Surius the Papiſt confeſſes that he did iuſtly In Suppl.

                     Theſe Pardons haue no ground in holy Scripture or Primitiue Church, or Fathers of the Church, for a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, but are indeede the impoſtures of this In principio naſcē

Pope Alexander the fourth grants foure thouſand yeares, &amp; eight hundred Lents of pardon. Pope Celeſtine the fifth grants alſo to the ſaide Hoſpitall and the members, an hundred thouſand yeares of pardon. Pope Clement the fift grants alſo two thouſand and eight hundred yeares of pardon.

                     If Popes can giue ſo large pardons for ſinnes, and haue ſo good prayers, I muſe they cannot cure the Papiſts of bodily ſickneſſe: for ſickneſſe is the puniſhment of ſinne. rather Popes doe encreaſe their ſickneſſe by procuring Gods plagues and puniſhments to be inflicted vpon them for affecting ſuch practiſes to haue their ſinnes pardoned of Popes, when as it appertaineth onely to God.
                     They who are Gods deareſt Miniſters (I feare the Pope is none) haue no other power heerein, then to declare in Gods name forgiueneſſe of ſinne, (not to make them a pardon for money) if they truely beleeue in Chriſt, and repent, and ſo releaſe the band of diſcipline in open offenders, where the fruites of repentance appeare: and ſo the meaneſt miniſter of Chriſt by vertue of his ſpirituall office may declare abſolution of ſinnes to the truely penitent; but to forgiue ſinnes, none can or may doe it, but God alone. I, Eſay 43. 25. euen I, am hee that putteth away thy iniquities for mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes: Math. 11. 28. Luke 5. 21. Come vnto me all ye that are weary, and laden, and I will eaſe you; with a thouſand places of Scripture, exhorting all to come vnto Chriſt, and apply his bloud vnto their ſoules for the remiſſion of their ſinnes.

                     The inuention of Popes pardons was to maintaine their pride, the power vnlawfull, the cauſes vngodly, the vſe abhominable, and the end deceiueable, neyther by the Scriptures, or practiſe of the Primitiue Church warrantable.

nor doth it rightly hold the head, making the Church a monſter with two heads, the Pope a viſible Head on earth, and Chriſt in heauen the inuiſible Head. We beſeech you in the tender bowels of Chriſt to haue pitty vpon your owne ſoules, open your eyes without partiality, or preiudice to behold the truth and embrace it; and to moue your hearts with Peters wordes, 1 Pet, 2. 2. as newborne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that ye may grow thereby: ſo ſhall you, and we haue infinite cauſe to reioyce, and our Church ſay with Peter, yee were as ſheepe going aſtray, but are now returned vnto the chiefe ſhepheard and cap. 2. 25.

                     Thus hauing declared in part the corruptions of popiſh Doctrine, which muſt be reiected of all who deſire to be faithfull ſeruants to our Sauiour, or performe ſeruice acceptable vnto him; for what concord hath 2 Cor. 6. 15. 16. 
                        Chriſt with Belial? what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? Take heede of the Leauen of Rome, as our Sauiour Math. 16. 6. warnes his Diſciples of the leauen of the Phariſees and Sadduces, their pernicious doctrine full of errors, repugnant and decrogatory to Chriſt and his Goſpell.
                     It remaines and followes in the next place to touch, That if you beleeue and embrace al the points of moderne Popery, now broached and maintained in the Church of Rome, you cannot bee dutifull and obedient Subiects to our and your Soueraigne: and ſince I haue in my former Tractates, obiter, by the way, promiſcuouſly touched leſuiticall precepts, and practiſe in this kinde, papall depoſitions of Kings from their Regiment, and abſolutions of ſubiects from loyall obedience, applauding traytors by canonization &amp; commendation for treaſonable attempts: I will not be large and liberall heerein, onely propound a few poſitions, and propoſitions to your conſideration to iudge of them, whether they be not oppoſite to all loyall

obedience; which are maintained and divulged to the world by your great Doctors and Pillars of the Romane Church.
                     And firſt you are not ignorant, that very lately, Anno 1606. Pope Paul the fifth prohibited all the Romane Catholickes (ſo tearmed) by his Breue, that they ſhould not take the oath of Allegiance, vnto which they were enioyned by the Kings Maieſty; which argues hee would haue them refractary, in matters which onely, concerne ciuill obedience: for the ſcope of that oath tended to profeſſe and practiſe a dutifull allegiance to the King in all loyall ſubmiſſion. The like alſo did Pius quintus Pope, to the late Queene Elizabeth, commanding her Subiects to rebell, and diſcharging them from allegiance. But omitting theſe things as vulgarly knowne, I will goe to the Ieſuites ſchoole, and heare how they teach you.
                     If a Chriſtian King become an All Chriſtian Kings counted Heretickes, who are not Romane Catholickes. Hereticke, immediatly his people are freed from his command and their ſubiection, ſaith, Lib: Inſtit: Cath: Sect. 11. c. 23.

                        Papa poteſt omnia facere, quae Deus poteſt, The Pope can doe all that God can doe: horrible impiety, and intollerable flattery. And theſe tell the world, he can make and vnmake Kings, and the Popes like it well enough, excommunicating Kings, depoſing them, and diſpoſing of their Kingdomes to others. So that it mooued Art

                         King of Peru to ſay (as Benzo, and Lopez tell it) Inſigniter fatuum eſſe opertere papam, qui quae non haberet, alijs liberaliter largitur, vel carte impedentem nebulonem, qui eiectis veris poſſeſſoribus, alienas terras peregrinis addiceret, &amp; in mutuas cades mortale genus armaret: That either the Pope was an egregious

Sot, who would liberally giue things which he had not, or a very impudent companion, who expulſing the true poſſeſſors, giues it to ſtrangers, arming the world to mutuall, yea mortall ſlaughters.
                     I will not trouble my ſelfe to behold the nakedneſſe, rather wickedneſſe of theſe drunken Gen. 9 21. Noes, vncouered in the midſt of their Tents, vomiting out vile poſitions, full of ſedition, and diſobedience againſt the Kings of the earth: it require rather teares to bewaile it, then a pen to report it: and the learned heerein know more then I write, and for the ignorant, it is good for them in this caſe to be ignorant ſtill: yet I confeſſe I aimed moſt in this labour to informe the ignorant, hauing no minde to meddle with ſeducing Profeſſed pandars to the Romiſh Curtezan, inuiolably fixed to her folly and fornication. Prieſts (I cannot charme ſuch deafe Adders:) if this litle handfull of my loue and labour preſented vnto you may be profitable to win any of you, I will ſay, and end with the Iames 5. 19. 20. Apoſtle Iames, Brethren, if any of you haue erred from the Truth, and ſome man hath conuerted him, let him know that hee which hath conuerted the ſinner from going aſtray out of his way, ſhall ſaue a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes.
                     The Lord, who is a God of Truth, for his mercy ſake, and for Chriſts merits ſake, open all your eies to behold the Truth, and your hearts to embrace it, that we may all hold one Head in vnity, and haue one heart in verity, that all with one minde, and mouth may praiſe, and pray vnto the Lord in the militant Church on earth, and be thrice happy members of the Triumphant Church in heauen.
                     Amen.
