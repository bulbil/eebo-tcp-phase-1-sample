            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               VVHen Achimaaz the sonne of Zadoc requested that he might be the messenger to bring Dauid word of Absoloms death, Ioab would not suffer him: Thou shall not (saith he) be the messenger 
               2 Sam. 18. 19, 20. 
               to day, but thou shalt carry newes another time, but to day thou shalt carry none; for the Kings sonne is dead. He knew Dauids affection was such, that the newes of his childes death would bee most heauie to him, and the messenger himselfe not welcome for his message sake.
            This is all our infirmity, no tidings more grieuous to us, then when wee heare of the death of those whom wee loue. The Parent bewailes his Childe, the Husband his Wife, the Friend laments the death of his Friend, and wee thinke it the losse of another friend to depart with this our griefe. Iacob mourned for Ioseph his sonne, that hee would not bee comforted of a long season, but thought hee would Gen. 37. 3. weepe for him as long as he liued. When the Amalekites had burned Ziklag, and led away captiue the mens wiues and their children, Dauid 
               1 Sa. 30. 4. Ioh. 1

                  . 19. and his campany wept, till they could weepe no more. When Lazarus died, his sisters, Martha and Mary were much discomforted for him. So heauie a thing wee see it is to bee seuered for a time from those that are deare vnto us. One onely thing there is, which is able in this case much to temper our affections; when we see our friend to die in the Lord; that is, in comfort of conscience, and assurance of saluation through Christ.
            
            This blessed departure God giues to many, for diuers good purposes. First, that the world may know that peace is the end of the iust, and comfort in death is the portion of the righteous. Secondly, That his eternall truth in our holy profession may appeare to bee able to comfort us, not only in our life, but in our death also, when all other comforts forsake vs. Thirdly, that our enemies may see our faith is not in vaine. Fourthly, that the weake by their example may be encouraged to a holy life, when they see it bring with it so happy a death, and that they may be strengthened against the feare of death, seeing it is alwayes comfortable to those that lead a godly life. Fifthly, and finally, that the friends of the departed, by their heauenly departure, may be admonished not to mourne so much for their death, as to reioyce for their life, and to thanke God, that euer it was their lot, in any degree to be ioyned or matched with so blessed seruants of God.
            
            
               
This Gentlewoman, Mistresse Katherine Brettergh was one of this number: her life, as long as God continued it, was deere to those among whom she was, as the life of a friend might be. Her husband, friends, kinsfolks, brethren, sisters, and all the godly that knew her, enioyed a great blessing of God of her: and her death (no doubt) was grievous to her husband, as the death of a vertuous yokefellow.
            This is the thing I thought with profit might bee presented to the view of other also that knew her not: for when I had for my owne priuate vse, and the vse of my friends faithfully collected (out of the fresh memories of those that were present, and eie-witnesses as well as my selfe) and set downe the manner of her sicknesse and death: I considered, that the knowledge thereof could not but bee welcome to all those that desire to dye the death of the righteous. And so the same causes that moued me to collect it, gaue mee also occasion to publish it. I remembred the saying of one, That it is is great piety to set forth the vertues of the departed, if they haue excelled therein; yea it is

               a meanes to encrease grace in our selues. I thought so great mercie of God shewed to one among vs, ought not to be forgotten, but should remaine to us and our children an example, to teach vs how good God is to them that loue him, and to assure vs that he will neuer forsake vs; but, in like manner as he did her, helpe and comfort vs, when we shall by death be called vnto him. I considered the vngodly and vncharitable tongues of the Papists abiding in our Country, who, since her death, haue not ceased to giue it out, that she died despairing, and by her comfortlesse end, shewed that she professed a comfortlesse Religion. Wherein they bewray their malice and madnesse, and shew themselues of what generation they are, euen a people (saith Ieremie) which bend their tongues like bowes for lies: and (as Dauid saith) make

                  . Psal. 11. 2. 
               ready their arrowes to shoot at them which are vpright in heart. And lastly, when I remembred the censure giuen by our Sauiour Christ of the woman, that powred costly oyntment on his head, a little before his Passion, though some of his Disciples vniustly blamed her for the same, saying, What needed this wast? yet he himselfe did not only excuse her for that fact, saying, shee did it to bury him: but also commanded, that wheresoeuer the Gospell should bee preached throughout the world, there also that which shee had done should bee spoken of, for a 
               Mat. 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 
               memoriall of her. Euen so, seeing this vertuous Gentlewoman hath been vniustly accused by some popish persons, I thought it 
                  â€¢
               it, that she should not onely be iustly excused, but also that a true history of her holy life, and Christian death, should be now published in print, as a briefe history to be seene and read for a memoriall of her.
            I had no other odours wherewith to embalme her, I am but the penman, the thing it selfe was her owne, wrought in her by the spirit, of diuine prouidence, the which God grant that we may all imitate.
            Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            The holie Life and Christian Death, of Mistris KATHERIN BRETTERGH.
            
               THis Gentlewoman was borne in Cheshire, the daughter of Iohn Breuen of Breuenstapleford Esquire, well descended, and of an ancient House. Her education before her mariage was such, as became the profession of the Gospell, in godlinesse and purity of life and Religion, and well beseemed the house where shee was brought 
               Stapleford. 
               up. The Scriptures shee knew from a childe, and by reading thereof, gained such knowledge, that shee was able readily to apply them when occasson was offered, as we may see at the time of her death, and that so fitly, and effectually, that shee seemed to haue made them her dayly meditation. For the things of this world shee was moderate, and sober, and by her Christian life and death, shee might teach many Gentlewomen, how vaine the pleasures and fashions of this World are, and how farre vnable to bring that peace to a distressed heart, that the embracing of true Religion can.

               Psal. 84. 10. 
               or to dwell in the tents and tabernacles of the vngodly. The Sabbath day was alwaies deere and welcome to her, what time shee would not be without the Word preached, though many times she went farre for it. Her delight was still to consecrate it glorious to the Lord. And as it is said of Iosiah, his heart melted when hee heard 
               2 Ki. 22. 19. 
               the Law; so may it be said of her, her heart was so tender, and full of compassion, that oftentimes she was scene to heare Sermons, reade, pray, and meditate with teares.
            
               
Shee made conscience of all slaue; yea, of the least sinne, such as worldlings count no sinne: shee neuer vsed to sweare oath great nor small; nor yet to abuse her tongue with vaine or vnseemely speeches; no not so much as a iest-lye, or immodest word; neither durst shee name the Name of GOD, or take his titles in her mouth without great reuerence. In priuate speech where shee might speake with profit, shee did it so well, that her speeches might haue beene deliuered by a stronger vessell then her selfe: her words being so well seasoned, and proceeding from such a sanctified heart, did alwaies minister grace to the hearers. 
               Psal. 16. 3.
            
            To reade, to pray, to sing, to meditate, was her dayly exercise; and her chiefest delight was in the holy society of the Saints vpon earth (which I say not for any cause, but only to shew the fountaine from whence her godly end flowed, and that the World may see some there be, which chuse rather to bee ioyned with the people Heb. 11. 25. of God, than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season; and these I doubt not haue chosen the better part.) Finally, the precepts of the Lord were precious vnto her; for from her childehood she feared God, and walked before him: both knowledge and sanctification did ioyne in her, the fruites and effects whereof did appeare in her life, and was seene at her death, to the glory of God, and comfort of all beholders.
            She was not like the simple Popish women of our dayes, which 2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. Act. 17, 11, 12. 
               are euer learning, and neuerable to come to the knowledge of the truth; but rather like the Noble men and women of Berea, which receiued the Word of God with readinesse, and were able to discerne of Paul and Silas preaching. But why doe I speake of Popish women, whose vnderstandings are darker than the darkenesse of Egypt: Let vs come and examine many other which seeme to detest Poperie, and aske them a reason of their faith; they can tell you a tale of their ruffes, and their pride, and their vanity: but for Religion, it is the least thing they regard, or seeke to know: which I speake not so much to solace my selfe in the sinnes and simplicitie of others, as earnestly desiring all Gentlewomen, that either knew this holy Saint of God, or hereafter shall heare of her, in stead of your glasses at home, wherein you pricke and prune, and pinne your selues, to looke into this glasse before your eyes, that so her life, and death, may bee an example for you to follow.
            
               
When she was about twenty yeeres old, (by the consent of her selfe and her friends) she was married to a young Lancashire Gentleman, Master William Brettergh of Bretterghoult neere Liuerpoole: one that likewise embraced Religion sincerely, and for the same indured many grieuances at the hands of Papists.
            Two yeeres and more she liued after she was married, and had issue onely one daughter: during which time, this couple liued together Anna Brettergh. in such mutuall ioy and comfort, as well beseemed the children of God, which make profession of his truth.

               rejoyced, then sorrowed; turning it into matter of praising God, and submitting her selfe to his good prouidence. Oft shee would haue said, It is good that such things bee; but woe bee to them that doe them. It is good in God, thereby to chasten his children, and preuent some sinne, which he saw vs like to fall into. It is good in respect of Gods Church, that the weake may be confirmed in the truth; and that Papistry may bee disgraced, when the World shall see such wickednesse flow from it. It is good in GOD, that so the wicked may bee without excuse at the day of iudgement, when their conscience shall tell them, that howsoeuer GOD suffers them to doe such villanie for some iust cause

knowne to himselfe; yet they commit it only of malice and reuenge. Oftentimes also in these vexations, shee would haue said; the mercies of God are infinite, who doth not onely by his Word, but also by his Justice, make vs fit for his Kingdome. Little doe our enemies know, what good by these things they doe vnto vs, and what wracke they bring to their owne Kingdome, while they se

Many times shee would pray that God would forgiue them, which had done them this hurt, and send them repentance: and shee would call vpon her husband, that hee would doe the like, and blesse them that cursed him. And for feare Mat. 5. 44. lest her husband should faile in that point through infirmity and weakenesse, as it is said of Iob, who offered sacrifice for his sonnes, lest peraduenture they should sinne, and blaspheme God in their

               hearts: so shee neuer failed, but dayly prayed vnto the Lord to sanctifie her husbands thoughts, and direct his heart aright, onely to seeke Gods glory, without either desire of reuenge, or satisfying his owne affections. So humble was her spirit, so carefull to auoide and preuent sinne, both in her selfe and others: and so milde of nature, that as Iacob with his mildenesse softned the malicious Gen. 33. 3, 4. heart of Esau his brother: and Dauid by his kindenesse in the caue, changed the fury of Saul, into weeping and confession, that Dauid was more righteous than hee: so shee by her meekenesse, humility, 1 Sam. 14. 17, 18. and vnspotted carriage in the World, forced some of the aduersaries to religion, to speake well of her.
            For her life, shee was well reported of all that knew her. Pitifull and bountifull was shee to the poore, and slacked no opportunity to doe good wherein she could; but constantly held her course, and kept her times of praying, reading, and meditating, (wherein shee had plentifull gifts) and contiuuasly used the same at such times as were fitting for her estate, sex, and calling. At the exercises of Religion, as prayer and instruction in her family, she would not be wanting: besides priuate prayer, and meditation which she omitted not, but vsed dayly, both in her chamber, as also abroad secretly and solitarily in the Orchard, Garden, or Fields, as Isacks manner was. In reading the Scriptures shee vsed euermore Ge. 24. 63. to taske her selfe, eight Chapters a day at the least, and for the time which shee saw euill or idlely spent, without doing some good, shee vsed to call the time of tentation. Many times also

she would read some godly writer, or expositor of Scripture, or in the booke of Martyrs; and was seene to weepe most bitterly, when either she had read of that which touched her affections neere, or of the cruell Martyrdome, which the deere Children of God were Exo. 13. 13. Psal. 16. 4. Ephes. 5. 3. Iudg. 6. 31, 32. Eccles. 4. 25. 28. put vnto, by the cruell and wicked tyrants of former dayes.
            For Popery, she saw it so grosse and foolish, that she would not once name it, except it were to argue against it, but neuer for it: so zealous was shee of Gods glory, and loued the truth so entirely, that shee would not once open her mouth to plead for Baal.
            
            Sinne aboue all things was hatefull vnto her, for thereat shee would haue grieued, as well when shee had seene it in others, as in her selfe. One or two examples I cannot omit, wherein shee bewrayed a worthy spirit, sanctified by the Spirit of God, and prepared for all the assaults of Satan. On a time, as her husband and shee were riding toward the Church, he was angry with his man: Alas husband (quoth shee) I feare your heart is not right towards God, that can be thus angry for a trifle: And weeping shee said further, you must pray against this your affection, and alwayes bee sure your anger bee of God, for else how dare you appeare this day before his Minister? And offer vp your prayers in the publike congregregation of the saints of God? Another time, a Tenant of her husbands, being behinde with his rent, shee desired him to beare yet with him a quarter of a yeere, which he did: and when the man brought his mony, with teares she said to her husband: I feare you doe not well to take it of him though it be your right, for I doubt he is not well able to pay it, and then you oppresse the poore. So great a compassion had shee of other mens wants, that all things being duely considered, and rightly weighed, methinks I may say of her, as Paul said of Timothie, I know none like minded. 
               Phil. 2. 20.
            
            Thus after she was married, shee continued in the things shee had learned, and held her profession with much sincerity, that the common enemies to our religion (the very Papists) had nothing to say against her, but confessed her life was vnreprooueable. And as for the godly that knew her, they alwayes acknowledged that modesty, and vertuous carriage in her, ioyned with knowledge and practise of all the duties of religion, that they had lust cause to report of her, as of a sound and faithfull professor of the Gospell.

On Saturday seuen-night before Whitsonday, what time she sickened, she began to feele some May 23. little infirmity and weakenesse of faith, more than shee had wont to shew, but shee soone ouercame it. On Munday night it encreased vpon her, and the assault of the enemie began to be sharpe, and May 25. so continued till the next day at afternoone; what time God deliuered her, and sent her peace, and comfort of conscience, and so encreased the same in her continually till shee died. The manner of her affliction was this:
            First, the seuerity of Gods iustice, and the greatnesse of her sinnes began to come into her minde, which much afflicted her, M. William Brettergh. Master Will. Fox. M. Edward Aspinwall. M. Iohn Brettergh. Mistris Ma

Then shee accused her selfe of pride, that shee had delighted to much in her selfe, and her beauty. Afterwards she thought she had no faith, but was full of hypocrisie, and had not embraced religion so earnestly, nor glorified God so worthily (especially with her tongue, which oft she repeated) nor loued him so sincerely, as she ought to haue done. Sometime she would cast her Bible from her, and say: It was indeed the booke of life, but shee read the same vnprofitably, and therefore feared it was become to her the booke of death. Sometimes she would say her sinnes had made her a prey to Satan; a spectacle to the world; a disgrace to religion; and a shame to her husband, kindred, and all true Christians: and here she would weepe bitterly. Sometime the originall corruption wherein she was borne, troubled her, and the sinnes of her parents, and the common parents of all, the eaters of the forbidden fruit: as if that had made her vnworthy of God,

and were then laid to her charge. Many times shee accused her selfe of impatience, bewailing the want of feeling Gods Spirit, and making doubt of her election, and such like infirmities. She wis

Sometimes she was very dull in prayer, and once when shee should haue said, Leade vs not into tentation, shee made a stop, saying, I may not pray; I may not pray (being interrupted, as she said, by Satan) and so shewed much discomfort: howbeit she was not

Many times with a cheerefull countenance she would desire those that were by, not to faint, or to giue her ouer, but constantly to pray, and helpe her against the tempter. Once in the midd'st of her tentation, being demanded by Master William Fox: whether

               she did beleeue the promises of God, or no? and whether she could pray? she answered. O that I could, I would willingly but hee will

I beleeue the remission of (my) sinnes, the resurrection of (my) body, and eternall life (to me) Amen. And hauing done, shee would pray God to confirme her in that

                might most fitly answere her discomforts. Also he directed her to consider the Passion and Prayer of our Sauiour Christ, for all his, Iohn 17. Matth. 26. Luke 22. 23. But especiall did hee often i

                  ase you. But the difficulty she had sometimes to apply these

generals vnto her owne soule in particular, made the ease more full of anguish to her felfe, and fearefull and lamentable to the standers by: Albeit shee acknowledged Gods Maiesty, mercy, faithfulnesse, and truth; yet still complained she of her owne weaknesse, and vnworthinesse, and could hardly appropriate each thing to her selfe.
            To helpe her somewhat herein (for properly otherwise, it is the peculiar worke of the holy Spirit of God, to perswade the heart and soule of her particular interest in these generall promises) she was told, that the Almighty who was mercifull, as she had proued, and faithfull, as she confessed, intended all these mercies to as many as hee did call, and make promise to. And that hee called her shee must needes confesse, both because that then shee not onely her selfe read, but hard others reade those blessed words of God vnto her: and also for that in former times, she had been touched with the loue of God, and that his truth: and had well profited in the detestation of sinne, and imitation of her Sauiour in a holy life. And for the proofe thereof, shee was wished to remember in former times her Baptisme, her frequenting of Sermons, and often receiuing the most comfortable repast of the holy Communion, her dayly, and almost continuall exercise of reading, meditating, and praying, &amp;c. Also hee assured her, that neither the present agony she was in, nor the speeches th

Nay (saith hee) I pray you consider, what corments God inflicted vpon his deare Sonne on the Crosse: did hee not cry out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? He complained, that his soule was heavie vnto death; yet was he heard in that which he feared, and God deliuered him. After this, hee read vnto her the 22. Psalme, wherein Dauid complained partly of his owne, but principally of the most bitter anguish which our Sauiour Christ endured, and suffered in body and soule, putting her in minde, that her case was not so bad as Davids, not much vnlike our Sauiours, who endured all that, and more for her; and therefore she had no cause to feare, seeing Christ had obtained victory, and would vndoubtedly bee with her, deliuer her, and eternally glorifie her with himselfe for euermore; and so continually hee propounded to her such comfortable places of Scripture as might meete with her infirmities. This greatly refreshed her, and gaue her occasion many times to call vpon God, for increase of grace, and deliuerance from her grieuous temptations: The which God of his accustomed goodnesse vouchsafed, on Tuesday, about three a clocke in the afternoone, what time May

            This is the summe of that temptation which she had, wherein what can any man see that might giue iust occasion to report our religion comfortlesse, or the Gentlewoman died despairing? This we are sure of, that to be without temptation is the greatest temptation: as also, that nothing

due thereunto, if God in iustice should reward her; no maruell if she brake out sometime into heauie complaints. I make no question it was the worke of God in her, to suffer Satan to accuse her, and afflict her for her sinnes, that so shee might the better see them, and consider the ha

Fox. she receiued any meate, shee prayed God not onely to sanctifie those creatures for her bodily sustenance, but also to fill her soule with the waters of life, often repeating that of the Reuelation, To him that thirsteth, will I giue of the waters of life freely.
            
            One time she tooke her Bible in her hand, and ioyfully kissing it, and looking vp toward Heauen, she said that of the Psalme: O Lord, it is good for mee that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy statutes: The law of thy mouth is better to mee than thousands of gold and siluer.
            
            Another time shee called her husband to her, and said: O Husband, beware of Papistry, keepe your selfe holy before the Lord: Yeeld not to the abomination of the wicked, lest they reioyce, and so you dishonour God, and destroy your owne soule. Againe shee said, Let my little Childe bee brought vp among the Children of God, and in the true feare and knowledge of his Maiesty; so shall I meete her in heauen, whom now I must leaue behinde me on earth.
            
            Againe sometime she would pray with a low voyce to her selfe, and that saying of Paul, Wee haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to feare any more, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby wee

cry Abba father, was much in her mouth: and the last words Abba father, she would double oftentimes ouer. She would sing to her selfe the last verse of the 13. Psalme.

                  I will giue thankes vnto the Lord, and praises to him sing:
                  Because he hath heard my request, and granted my wishing.
               
            
            Finally, in these and such like exercises and meditations, did she spend the whole time of her sicknesse, after the Lord had once enlarged her heart from the tentations of Satan.
            But vpon Saturday about eleuen of the clocke in the morning, Maij 30. the Lord disclosed himselfe in mercy, to her more plentifully, than euer before, and as I may say, hee dealt familiarly with his handmaid: for from that time, to her very death, which ensued the next day, the feeling of Satans tentations seemed quite to be banished from her; so that she made no shew of them, her thoughts were not occupied with the world, husband, childe, or any thing else, to our thinking; neither was her sickenesse troublesome to her, as before it had beene: but as one raised from death to life, or rauished in spirit, so seemed shee to vs that stood by: her countenance ioyfull: her tongue flowing with the praises of God: and her voyce as most heauenly musicke and melody of peace, sounding praise, and honour, and glory to God in a wonderfull manner, as followeth.
            About eleuen of the clocke shee began to tremble and quake a little, and withall shee asked her husband if he would helpe her William Brettergh. Maud Brettergh. Elizabeth Challoner. with prayer to God against the tempter, saying, will yee neither pray with me, nor bring some godly man that may put holy things into my minde, whereby I may bee able to resist Satan: hauing thus said, shee vttered these words: O Lord God of my saluation, helpe my weaknesse, plead thou my cause, O God of truth, for in thee doe I trust. After this, they prayed together, and shee answered Amen to euery petition. Then after this shee required him to reade some part of the Scripture: whereupon hee read vnto her the 8. to the Romans, the 91. Psalme, and the 17. of Iohn, the which as he read, and came to the fourth verse, I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe, and now glorifie me: She desired him to pause a while, and then said, Blessed be thy name, O blessed Sauiour, perfect the worke I humbly beseech thee which thou hast begun in me. Then as he read the 9. verse, I pray not

for the world, but for them which thou hast giuen me, for they are thine: she interrupted him againe, saying, O Lord Iesu, dost thou pray for me? O blessed and sweet Sauiour, How wonderfull! how wonderfull! how wonderfull are thy mercies! Reade on said shee, the blessedst reading that I euer heard, the comfort whereof doth sweeten my soule. Then reading verse the 22. And the glorie which thou gauest me, I haue giuen them, that they may be one as we are one. With maruellous ioy she vttered the words of Dauid many times ouer, I confesse before the Lord his louing kindnesse, and his wonderfull workes before the sonnes of men: for hee 
               Psal. 107. 8, 9. 
               hath satisfied my soule, and filled my hungry soule with goodnesse. When he came to the 24. verse, Father I will that they which thou hast giuen me, be with me, euen where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast giuen mee; Stay, said shee, and let mee meditate on the goodnesse of the Lord, for this is the sweetest saying that euer came to my soule: for now I perceiue and feele the countenance of Christ my redeemer is turned towards me, and the bright-shining beames of his mercy is spread ouer me: Oh happie am I, that euer I was borne, to see this blessed day! Praise, O praise the Lord, for his mercies; for hee hath brought mee out of darkenesse, and the shadow of death; he hath deliuered my soule from the snare of the hunter, a

               praise his holy name: my soule praise thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefits, which forgiueth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thine infirmities: which hath redeemed thy life from the graue, and crowneth thee with mercy and compassion. This shee often repented: And then againe remembring the 21. and 22. verses of the 17. of Iohn, shee said: O my sweet Sauiour, shall I be one with thee, as thou art one with thy Father? And wilt thou glorifie mee with that glory which thou haddest with the Father before the world was? And doest thou so loue me (which am but dust and ashes) to make me partaker of glory with Christ? What am I poore 
               Psal. 144. 3. Psal. 8. 4. 
               wretch, that thou art so mindefull of me? Oh how wonderfull! how wonderfull! how wonderfull is thy loue! Oh thy loue is vnspeakable, that hast dealt so graciously with mee! oh I feele thy

mercies, and oh that my tongue and heart were able to sound forth thy praises as I ought, and as I willingly would doe! oh that you all would helpe me to praise the holy one of Israel, the God of all consolations! And thus for the space of fiue houres together at the least, she continued praising and lauding the Lord, with such a gladsome and heauenly countenance, testifying such inward ioy, from a comfortable feeling of the mercies of God in her soule, and vsing such sweet sentences and sugred phrases of perfect and holy eloquence, as the truth thereof, if it could haue beene taken, were admirable, continuing so many houres together; some part whereof was this.
            
               O my Lord, oh my God, blessed bee thy name for euermore, which hast shewed me the path of life. Thou didst, O Lord, hide thy face from me for a little season, but with euerlasting mercy, thou 
               Isai. 54. 8. 
               hast had compassion on me: And now blessed Lord thy comfortable presence is come, yea Lord, thou hast had respect vnto thy handmaid and art come with fulnesse of ioy, and abundance of consolations: O blessed be thy name, O Lord my God. Then shee repeated part of the 16. Psalme, saying: The Lord is the portion of 
               Psalm. 16. 5. 9. 11. 
               mine inheritance, wherefore my heart is glad, and my tongue reioyceth: Thou wilt shew mee the path of life: In thy presence is fulnesse of ioy, and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore: Oh that I could therefore praise the Lord, as he is worthy to be praised! I will sing to the Lord, I will sing to the praise of the God of Israel: come, come, (saith she) and helpe me, O helpe me to praise 
               Iudg. 5. 3. 
               the Lord. And with that shee began to sing the third Psalme, and continued to the end of the Psalme, as perfectly, and with as sweet a voyce, as euer she had before in her health; and concluded with the 49. verse of the 106. Psalme.

                  The Lord the God of Israel, be blest for euermore:
                  Let all the people say Amen, praise ye the Lord therefore.
               
            
            And after this she said, O praise the Lord, for he hath filled mee 
               Psal. 16. 6. 
               with ioy and gladnesse of heart, and brought me from the gates of hell, and of death: repeating that of the 16. Psalme, My line is fallen vnto me in a pleasant place: yea I haue a faire heritage, for the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance: The place where I now am, is sweet and pleasant: oh how pleasant is the sweet perfume of the place where I lye!

                  ect is the Law of God, &amp;c. and so on to the end of the same. And after that spirituall reioycing, in singing of Psalmes, shee then prayed vnto God faithfully, and praysed the Lord againe ioyfully. And being still full of these, and such like heauenly consolations, she did sing againe most hartily, vnto the praise of God the 136. Psalme, Praise ye the Lord for he is good, for his mercy indureth for euer: &amp;c. In which Psalme, for his mercy endureth for euer, is 26. times repeated. A Christian friend comming in at M. William Fox. the same time, which was about six of the clocke in the euening, maruelling to see her exceeding ioyes, and heauenly harmonie, wherein she continued with such words and phrases, that were so spirituall, prayed for the continuance of the same vnto the end: whereupon she then burst out, relating further of her ioyes, saying: William Brettergh. Will. Fox. Will. Woodward. 
               Oh the ioyes! the ioyes! the ioyes! that I feele in my soule! oh they be wonderfull! they be wonderfull! they be wonderfull! And after that, shee prayed for increase of faith, and that God would strenghthen her against tentations, with continuall crauing of remission of sinnes, euer meditating of heauenly matters, as by her sudden and often breaking out into heauenly speeches, and phraises, did appeare: for the same euening shee lying still and silent for a while, One prayed her to remember the Lord Jesus, Will. Fox. and that shee would in her heart, pray for constancy in her ioyfull course; whereupon shee answered with a delightsome and cheerefull countenance, and comfortable voyce: Oh (said shee) so I doe, for the Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom then shall I feare? Though an host pitch against me, yet my heart shall not be afraid, 
               Psal. 27. 1, 3 
               for the Lord hath said, I will not leaue thee nor forsake thee. Indeed, 
               Deut. 4. 31. 
               I should verily haue fainted, but that I beleeved to see the goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the liuing. And now my heart 
               Psal. 27. 13. Psal. 108. 1. 
               is ready, my heart is ready and prepared, yea it panteth after thee O God: as the Hart braieth after the riuers of water, so panteth my

                  2. 1, 2 
               soule after thee O God; my soule thirsteth for God, euen for the

liuing God. When Lord, when shall I come and appeare before thy presence? &amp;c. Saying then further, Lord, sith it hath pleased thee William Brettergh. 
               to prepare my heart, whether to life or death, thy will be done, dispose of me to thine owne glory, I am thine Lord, worke thy blessed pleasure, and good will vpon me. And after this shee fell into a short slumber, and awaking said, as the Spouse said vnto Christ in the Canticles, Oh come kisse me with the kisses of thy mouth, for thy loue is better than wine? Oh how sweet the kisses of my 
               Cant. 1. 1. 
               Sauiour be? Then one said vnto her, alluding to that place of S. Will. Fox. 
               Iohn, Reuel. 3. 8. and praying that the Lord would annoint her, with the eye-salue of his grace, that shee might see and behold his glory. To whom she answered, Mine eyes are opened, mine eyes are opened, though for a while thy were closed vp, and shut; yet now I thanke my God, mine eyes are opened and I doe feele and see the euerliuing mercies of my Christ: saying then further as it is in the 27. Psalme. Thou saidst, seeke my face: my heart answered to

               led to commit her soule into the hands of Christ, William Brettergh. Psal. 31. 5. she said: O Lord Iesus, thou hast redeemed me, pleade thou my cause, for into thy hands alone doe I commit my spirit, O thou God of truth. And then feeling more ioy to abound, one praising God with her for his great mercies shewed toward her, shee further William Woodward. Mat. 11. 25 said: I giue thee thanks O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise, and men of vnderstanding, and hast opened them vnto me thy poore handmaid, which am but dust and ashes. O how mercifull and merueilous gratious art thou vnto me! yea Lord, I feele thy mercy, and I am assured of thy loue, 
               William Fox. 
               and so certaine am I thereof, as thou art the God of truth, euen so sure doe I know my selfe to bee thine, O Lord my God; and this my soule knoweth right well, and this my soule knoweth right well:

                  7. which speech of her assurance, she often repeated. Presently after this sitting vp in her chaire, she sung the fourth Psalme; and then being laid downe againe in her bed, shee confidently sp

               ke these words: I am sure that my redeemer liueth, and that I shall see him at the last day, whom I shall see, and mine eye shall behold: and though after my skin, wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see

God in my flesh with these Eyes, and none other.
            
            Then came into see her toward euening, Master William Harrison the Preacher, praysing God for her continuance, in that her M. William Harrison. William Brettergh. Will. Fox. Iohn Brettergh. William Woodward. ioyfull and most happy course: and perswading her to an holy perseuerance in the same, shee thanked him, and desired him to reioyce in Christ with her, and to praise God for his mercies to her, and said. O Master Harrison, my soule hath been compassed about with terrors of death, feare within, and feare without, the sorrowes of hell were vpon me, knots and knorres were vpon my soule, (which twice or thrice she repeated) and a roaring wildernesse of woe, was within me; but blessed, blessed, blessed, bee the Lord my God, who hath not le

                  t me comfortlesse, but like a good shepheard, hath he brought mee into a place of rest, euen to the sweet running 
               Psalm. 23. 2. 3. 
               waters of life, that flow out of the Sanctuary of God, and he hath lead me into the greene pastures, where I am fed, and exceedingly comforted: yea, hee hath restored my soule, and lead me into the plaine and easie paths of righteousnesse. The way that now I goe in, is a sweet and easie way, strowed with flowers, and as a fine sandie 
               Psal. 147. 14. 
               way; yea, it is more easie and soft than the sand, for I goe and tread vpon wheat, euen vpon the finest flower of wheate: Oh blessed be the Lord; O blessed be the Lord, that hath thus comforted me, and hath brought me now to a place, more sweet vnto me, than the Garden of Eden. Oh the ioy! the ioy! the delight some ioy that I feele! Oh how wonderfull, how wonderfull, how wonderfull is this ioy! O praise the Lord for his mercies, and for this ioy, which my soule feeleth full well, praise his name for euermore. And these praises of God, she soundeth foorth, like Dauids harmonie, William Brettergh. William Woodward. being indued with Dauids spirit, to the praise of the eternall and mercifull God, continuing all night in such like prayers and prayses to God, except some small time, that shee was silent and quiet. Master Harrison prayed twice with her that euening, as also in the morning (being Whitsunday.) After hee had prayed once with her, going then toward his publike charge, shee sent for him, to pray once more with her before he went, which he did; to the ioy and gladnesse of heart, both of her, and all that were present: M. Edward Aspinwall. Will. Fox. William Brettergh. and so hee tooke leaue of her, and departed.
            Another faithfull man or two came presently in the morning, and diuers other well affected, who were with her at the time of

her death, and often prayed with her that forenoone, shee still Iohn Brettergh. William Woodward. Mistris Maud Brettergh. Mistris Scholastica Fox. Elizabeth Challoner. and diuers mo

Againe, one saying vnto her, the Lord blesse you: Yea, (said she) and the Lord Iesus blesse vs all. And so seeming to sleepe a little while, and awaking againe shee said: Lord I trust in thee, haue mercy vpon me, giue me strength to praise thee: defend and preserue me in the houre of tentation, and lay no more vpon mee, than thou wil

                   enable me to beare. Afterwards being asked, if shee would haue them ioyne in prayer together againe with her. O yes (said shee) for Christs sake I desire it: saying thus to her selfe: Heare O Lord, and haue mercy vpon me: Lord, bee thou my helper: thou hast loosed my sacke, and girded me with gladnesse: therefore will I praise thee, O Lord my God: I will giue thanks to thee for euermore, With that, all that were present did ioyne in prayer with her, and in conclusion 
                  â€¢
               sing the Lords prayer, which she said with them, to thine is thy kingdome; her strength then being gone, her tongue failed her, and so shee lay silent for a while, euery one iudgeing her then to be neere death, her strength and speech failing her: yet after a while lifting vp her eyes with a sweet countenance and still voyce, said: My warfare

Lord, whom haue I in Heauen but thee? and I haue none in earth but thee: my flesh faileth, and my heart also, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer. He that preserueth Iacob, and defendeth his Israel, he is my God, and will guide me vnto death: guide mee O Lord my God, and suffer me not to faint, but keepe my soule in safetie. And with that she presently fell asleepe in the Lord, passing away in peace, without any motion of body at all; and so yeelded vp the Ghost, a sweet Sabbaths sacrifice about foure of the clocke in the afternoone, on Whitesunday, being the last of May, 1601.
            This was the death of that vertuous Gentlewoman, happily dying in the Lord, and reaping the benefit of a holy profession: wherein wee cannot but acknowledge and reuerence the mercie of God, who in our greatest infirmitie makes his grace to shine most clearely.

And now for conclusion, seeing this blessed Gentlewoman is taken from among vs, and receiued into the holy habitations of the heauenly Jerusalem, there to remaine in ioy, glory, and blessednesse for euermore; let vs lament for our losse, but reioyce for her gaine: and let vs pray, that in heare wee could as willingly wish to bee with her, as she is now vnwilling to be with vs.
